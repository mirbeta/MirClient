-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this folder you may find DirectX shaders that are used for Direct3D 11
providers in the framework. These are also included in the source code in
compiled form. These are available for your own reference and require DirectX
SDK for compilation (specifically "fxc" tool).

OpenGL (ES) shaders are directly embedded in the framework source and can be 
found in "Source" folder.
