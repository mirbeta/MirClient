  IMPORTANT NOTICE:

    This file is part of Android's set of stable system headers exposed by the Android NDK (Native Development Kit)
    since platform release 1.5

    Third-party source AND binary code relies on the definitions here to be FROZEN ON ALL UPCOMING PLATFORM RELEASES.

    - DO NOT MODIFY ENUMS (EXCEPT IF YOU ADD NEW 32-BIT VALUES)
    - DO NOT MODIFY CONSTANTS OR FUNCTIONAL MACROS
    - DO NOT CHANGE THE SIGNATURE OF FUNCTIONS IN ANY WAY
    - DO NOT CHANGE THE LAYOUT OR SIZE OF STRUCTURES
 }

{
  Support routines to send messages to the Android in-kernel log buffer, which can later be accessed through the
  'logcat' utility.

  Each log message must have
    - a priority
    - a log tag
    - some text

  The tag normally corresponds to the component that emits the log message, and should be reasonably small.

  Log message text may be truncated to less than an implementation-specific limit (e.g. 1023 characters max).

  Note that a newline character ("\n") will be appended automatically to your log message, if not already there.
  It is not possible to send several messages and have them appear on a single line in logcat.

  PLEASE USE LOGS WITH MODERATION:

   - Sending log messages eats CPU and slow down your application and the system.

   - The circular log buffer is pretty small (<64KB), sending many messages might push off other important log messages
     from the rest of the system.

   - In release builds, only send log messages to account for exceptional conditions.

  NOTE: These functions MUST be implemented by /system/lib/liblog.so
