  capability, their attachment order, and the absence of the DDSCAPS_FRONTBUFFER and DDSCAPS_BACKBUFFER capabilities.

{ These flags indicate a presentation blt (i.e. a blt that moves surface contents from an offscreen back buffer to the
  primary surface). The driver is not allowed to "queue"  more than three such blts. The "end" of the presentation blt
  is indicated, since the blt may be clipped, in which case the runtime will call the driver with several blts. All
  blts (even if not clipped) are tagged with DDBLT_PRESENTATION and the last (even if not clipped) additionally with
  DDBLT_LAST_PRESENTATION. Thus the true rule is that the driver must not schedule a DDBLT_PRESENTATION blt if there
  are 3 or more DDBLT_PRESENTLAST blts in the hardware pipe. If there are such blts in the pipe, the driver should
  return DDERR_WASSTILLDRAWING until the oldest queued DDBLT_LAST_PRESENTATION blts has been retired (i.e. the pixels
  have been actually written to the primary surface). Once the oldest blt has been retired, the driver is free to
  schedule the current blt. The goal is to provide a mechanism whereby the device's hardware queue never gets more
  than 3 frames ahead of the frames being generated by the application. When excessive queueing occurs, applications
  become unusable because the application visibly lags user input, and such problems make windowed interactive
  applications impossible. Some drivers may not have sufficient knowledge of their hardware's FIFO to know when a
  certain blt has been retired. Such drivers should code cautiously, and simply not allow any frames to be queued at
  all. DDBLT_LAST_PRESENTATION should cause such drivers to return DDERR_WASSTILLDRAWING until the accelerator is
  completely finished- exactly as if the application had called Lock on the source surface before calling Blt.
  In other words, the driver is allowed and encouraged to generate as much latency as it can, but never more than 3
  frames worth. Implementation detail: Drivers should count blts against the SOURCE surface, not against the primary
  surface. This enables multiple parallel windowed application to function more optimally.
