Such electronic services may include, but are not limited to: incident submission, case management and Product Releases.

Support will not cover any adaptation or modification of the Product made by Licensee or any third party. The email and phone support hours shall be as identified on the Embarcadero support website.

Requests for Releases will only be honored during the support term. Physical media requires an additional charge.

6.3 TERMINATION OF SUPPORT. Licensee may cancel enrollment in Support upon written notice to Licensor at least thirty (30) days prior to the next Support Anniversary Date. If Licensee has failed to renew or terminated its enrollment in Support, for a period of up to six months from the Support expiration date, Licensee may re-enroll in Support by paying a reinstatement fee to be calculated based on Licensor's then current reinstatement policy and due for the period during which Licensee was not enrolled in Support. In addition, Licensee must pay the annual charge for Support for the next year in advance. Such reinstatement date shall then be considered the Support Anniversary Date. For the avoidance of doubt, Support reinstatement will not be permitted after six months of lapsed Support. Licensee agrees not to modify the Product without the prior written approval of Licensor. Unapproved alterations to the Product shall void any obligation by Licensor to provide Support for the Product, pursuant to this Section 6, during the warranty period and any subsequent period in which Licensee is enrolled in Support. Licensor may elect to cease offering support services at any time (i) for a particular Product version in the case where it has been replaced by newer release(s) and (ii) in the case where a particular Product has reached its end of life.

6.4 CHANGE OF SUPPORT FEES. Licensor reserves the right to change its then current published list prices for the Products and its charge for Support at any time prior to renewal. Any such change to Support shall not take effect until the completion of the then current support term.

6.5 SERVICES; UPDATES; PRODUCT CHANGES. Licensor is not required under this Agreement to provide any installation, training or other services to licensee. Such services, if available, must be purchased separately. If Licensee purchases support and Licensor provides licensee with a new release, error correction, update, upgrade or other modification to the Product, or Licensee separately purchases an upgrade such modification or upgrade will be deemed part of the Product, and subject to the terms of this Agreement, unless the modification is expressly provided subject to a separate license agreement. If licensee have acquired an upgrade version of the Product (whether through support or purchase of a separate upgrade), such upgrade constitutes a single Product together with the copy of the Product that licensee upgraded. This means that, although Licensee may have two sets of Product media and/or two license keys, licensee still has only one license. Therefore, licensee may not transfer the original copy of the Product or license key to any other party or user. Licensor reserves the right at any time not to release or to discontinue release of any Product and to alter prices, features, specifications, capabilities, functions, licensing terms, release dates, general availability or other characteristics of any future releases of the Product. If licensee acquires a Network Named upgrade or Concurrent upgrade license which includes rights to older product versions, then Licensee must deactivate the upgraded license upon installation of the upgrade license provided that the product version(s) of the upgraded license are also included in the upgrade license.

7. PAYMENT SCHEDULE.

Sixty (60) days prior to each annual Support Anniversary Date of the licensed Products, Licensor shall invoice Licensee the then-current fee for the next year of Support.

8. LIMITED WARRANTY AND CONDITIONS.

This warranty and condition shall not apply if (a) the Product is not used in accordance with applicable documentation; (b) Product defect has been caused by Licensee's malfunctioning equipment; or (c) Licensee has made modifications to the Product not expressly authorized in writing by Licensor. No employee, agent, or representative of Licensor has the authority to bind Licensor to any oral representations, warranties or conditions concerning the Product. Any written representation, warranty or condition not expressly contained in this Agreement shall not be enforceable.

10. INDEMNIFICATION FOR INFRINGEMENT. Licensor will defend or settle, at its own expense, any claim against Licensee asserting a copyright, trademark or trade secret which concerns the Product used within the scope of the Agreement hereunder.

Licensor's obligations under this Section are conditioned on Licensee promptly notifying Licensor in writing after Licensee first receives notice of any such claim, action or allegation of infringement and, Licensor being given sole control of the defense of any action and all negotiations for its settlement or compromise, with the reasonable assistance of Licensee. Licensor shall not be liable for any costs or expenditures incurred by Licensee without Licensor's prior written consent. If an injunction or order is obtained against Licensee's use of the Product by reason of the allegations of infringement, or if in Licensor's opinion the Product is likely to become the subject of a claim of infringement, Licensor shall, at its expense:

(a) Procure for Licensee the right to continue using the Product; or

(b) Modify or replace the Product with a compatible, functionally equivalent, non-infringing Product(s); or

(c) If neither (a) nor (b) is reasonably practical in Licensor's judgment, remove the Product and issue Licensee a pro rata credit based upon the License fees paid for the Product prorated over a thirty-six (36) month period from the date of shipment of the Product. Thereafter, termination shall proceed in accordance with the terms of Section 4.

If Licensee is entering into this Agreement as an entity other than an individual (e.g., as a corporation, a partnership, or other organization), Licensor may, at its expense, audit the number of copies of the Product in use by Licensee and the designated CPU(s) on which the Product is installed. Any such audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at Licensee's facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee's business activities. If an audit reveals that LICENSEE has underpaid fees to Licensor, Licensee shall be invoiced for such underpaid fees (based on the list prices in effect at the time the audit is completed); and if the underpaid fees exceed 5% of the License fees already paid, then Licensee shall also pay Licensor the reasonable costs of conducting the audit.
