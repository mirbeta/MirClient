Description:  ****          MtSrv is an old sample program         ****
              **** It works OK, but you should use ThrdSrv project ****
              This little application shows how to use the TWSocket in a
              multithreaded application. It is a very basic telnet werver.
              Each time a client connect to the server, he receive an "hello"
              message. Then every character sent is echoed back to the client.
              There are two units is this application: one for the main
              server code, and one for the client thread.
              Each time a client connect to the server, a new TWSocket is
              created and a new thread is launched to handle the client
              work. When the client disconnect, the TWSocket and the thread
              are destroyed.
              To see this demo working on your computer, start the demo then
              start several copies of the TELNET client program (the one which
              comes with Windows 95 is perfect). Then using each telnet, connect
              to 127.0.0.1. You'll see a new connection in the list box. You
              must receive the "hello" message and see each character as you
              type them. You can use the Disconnect button from the application
              or from the telnet client to see what happends (the connection
              should be closed).
