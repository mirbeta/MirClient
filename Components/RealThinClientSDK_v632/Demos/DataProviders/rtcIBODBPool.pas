  This unit is NOT used by the RealThinClient SDK nor by any RTC SDK examples!

  This is only an example DB Pool class implementation, written by Gerhard Knapp
  using IB*Objects to work with Firebird. Before you start using the code,
  you should take a couple of minutes to read what this is all about.

  In general, if you have a multithreaded server, you need a “pool” from which you
  will request a database connection when you need one, the return it when you don’t
  need it anymore. This pool has to create a new DB connection if there is no unused connection
  available and use critical sections to make sure that all threads will be able to access its methods.

  You can start by using a TList to act as your “pool”. You will need to implement 2 methods,
  I will call them “getDBConn” and “putDBConn”. “getDBConn” to “get” a DB connection object and
  “putDBCon(con:TDatabase)” to return unused connection object back into your pool.

  In “getDBCon”, first check if TList is empty. If Empty, create a new connection and add it to TList.
  Then, just take the last object from list (delete it from list) and return it as a result. The list
  will have at least one object in it, since you have created this in case it was empty before.
  In “putDBConn”, simply add the object back into TList.

  The only important thing here is that you use one critical section to secure both functions, so that
  you can securely work with the pool from all threads. To do this, you will use one critical section
  inside the get and the put method, like this …

  CS.Enter;
  try
     // your code
  finally
    CS.Leave;
    end;

  Then, inside each RTC method you will call getDBObj to obtain a database connection object and
  afterwards call putDBObj to return it back to your database connection pool. Also use try/finally
  to make sure that object will be returned to the pool, even if exception should be raised somewhere
  inside your code, like this …

  myDB := getDBConn;
  try
    // work with “myDB” database connection
  finally
    putDBConn(myDB);
    end;

  Well, that’s all there is to database connection pooling. You will need one TList, one TRtcCritSec and
  implement one “get” and one “put” method. You can enhance this implementation by adding a second list,
  where you will maintain a list of used database objects, so you can close them when your application
  closes, even if they weren’t returned back to the pool. But, that is not really necessary if you keep
  true to the simple rule: getDBConn has to be followed by putDBConn in a try/finally block.

  Since the best way to learn is by example, here is a Database Pool class example. It won’t compile if you
  don’t have IB*Objects installed, but it should show you how you can implement your own Database pooling …
