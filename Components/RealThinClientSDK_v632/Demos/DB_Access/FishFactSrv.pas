  RTC Fish Facts Server Demo Project
  @html(</b>)
  - Copyright 2004-2013 (c) RealThinClient.com (http://www.realthinclient.com)
  @html(<br><br>)

  This Project shows how to write a Server to provide Client-side access to Server-side
  Data, as well as a way to modify that Data by using DB-aware components on the Client.

  This Server Project is written to work with "FishFactsClient" and "FishFactsClient2" Projects,
  but can be modified to work with any other Client using TRtcMemDataSet or TRtcDataSetMonitor.

  This Project uses a TRtcMemDataSet component as a Server-side Data source.

    { In a real Database Application Server, working with a real Database, you would implement a
      DB connection Pool, from which you would be taking out a DB connection before you need access
      to the Database, then use that DB connection to get a TDataSet containing selected records,
      copy that TDataSet contents into a TRtcDataSet (for example, using the "DelphiDataSetToRTC"
      function), then release the TDataSet received from the Database and return the DB connection
      back to the Database connection Pool, so it can be used again later. By doing that, you
      will be able to make the Server Multi-Threaded and scale under different loads, without
      losing too much time opening and closing DB connections for each access.

      Here is a pseudo-code example for working with a real Database:

      // Get a DB Connection from a DB connection pool
      MyDBConnection := Get_Connection_From_DB_Pool();
      try
        // Get a Query object from a Query object pool, or create a Query object on-demand
        // and execute a Query using "MyDBConnection" with parameters "MyQueryParameters".
        // This will return a TDataSet descendant allowing at least read access
        MyQuery := Execute_Query( MyDBConnection, MyQueryParameters );
        try
          // Copy the contents of our Query (TDataSet) to our Result object,
          // so it will be sent back to the Client ...
          DelphiDataSetToRTC( MyQuery, Result.newDataSet );

          // If we need more than a DataSet, we can place our DataSet inside a Record, like ...
          //   Result.newRecord; <- create a Record instead of a DataSet
          //   Result.asRecord.asBoolean['ok']:=True; <- example additional parameter
          //   DelphiDataSetToRTC( MyQuery, Result.asRecord.newDataSet('data') ); <- place a dataset inside the "data" field of our record
          // ... in which case the Client would have to access the DataSet through the record,
          // because Result.isType would then return rtc_Record and not rtc_DataSet, and
          // Result.asRecord.isType['data'] would return rtc_DataSet (the DataSet we sent).
        finally
          // Release the "MyQuery" object
          Release_Query(MyQuery);
          end;
      finally
        // Return the "MyDBConnection" back to our DB Connection pool
        Put_Connetion_To_DB_Pool(MyDBConnection);
        end; }

    { Since this Project is a very simplified example which does NOT use a Database,
      but instead uses a single TRtcMemDataSet instance containing all data from our single Table
      and because this example is designed to work ONLY in Single-Threaded mode, the following
      line is all we will need to copy the complete Table from RtcMemDataSet1 to the Result object ... }

    Result.asDataSet := RtcMemDataSet1.asDataSet;

    { The line above ONLY works with the TRtcMemDataSet component!

      When using any other TDataSet descendant, you will either call the "DelphiDataSetToRTC"
      function as shown in the pseudo-code example above, or write your own function to copy
      fields and records from DB components you are using - if they are not TDataSet descendants.

      Because TRtcMemDataSet is also a TDataSet descendant, this line would also work:
        DelphiDataSetToRtc( RtcMemDataSet1, Result.newDataSet );

      But since our TRtcMemDataSet is linked to a DBGrid, we would need to disable controls
      before copying and enable them afterwards to avoid the DBGrid scrolling up and down. }

      all actions performed by the Client and decide what to do with them here. }

          Even though the code below looks rather complex and long, you will NOT need to
          do the same when working with a real Database, especially if it has SQL support!

          To see an example on how the SQL statement might look like for executing
          the current action (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) on a table "Biolife", check the
          implementation of the "GetActionSQL" method used below. This method is used here
          only to display a simplified SQL for each change received from the Client
          and should NOT be used 1:1 for executing SQL statements on a Database,
          because it uses RTC Format for data and NOT propper SQL formats.

          In a real Database Server Application, you will most likely be preparing an
          SQL statement and using parameters to fill in field values for "WHERE",
          "UPDATE" and "INSERT" clauses, to make sure all field types are set correctly. }

            nor do we have any functions for locating a record by using key fields,
            we will be going sequentially through the whole table while searching
            for a place to execute our Update or Delete action. Yes, this is a very
            "quick and dirty" way of doing things, but since you would NEVER EVER
            want to use the TRtcMemDatSet on the *Server* side to keep or update data
            from a Database, we can live with this implementation - HERE ... }

      to the TRtcDataSet object contained inside the TRtcMemDataSet are not automatically
      reflected in DB-aware components, we need to use "Refresh" for the DBGrid to get updated.

      you would normally do in a real Server working with a real Database! }
