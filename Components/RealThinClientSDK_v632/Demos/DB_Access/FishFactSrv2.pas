  RTC Fish Facts Server 2 Demo Project
  @html(</b>)
  - Copyright 2004-2013 (c) RealThinClient.com (http://www.realthinclient.com)
  @html(<br><br>)

  This Project shows how to write a Server to provide Client-side access to Server-side
  Data, as well as a way to modify that Data by using DB-aware components on the Client.

  This Server Project is written to work with "FishFactsClient" and "FishFactsClient2" Projects,
  but can be modified to work with any other Client using TRtcMemDataSet or TRtcDataSetMonitor.

  This Project uses the BDE and a single TQuery component as a Server-side Data source,
  demonstrating the use of data received from RTC Clients to generate SQL staments for
  selecting data from a real Database and updating data inside a real Database, and
  could be easily modified for use with any SQL-capable components for Database Access.

    raise Exception.Create('Table parameter required')

  { In this particular example, we only have one table, which we called 'biolife' ... }

  else if Param.asText['table']='biolife' then
    begin
    { This Project is very simplified and uses only one TQuery object placed on the Main Form.
      Using this approach, the BDE will always see only one user (no concurrent Database access),
      but it will ONLY work in Single-Threaded mode, so it is NOT recommended for heavy-load Servers.

      In a real Database Application Server, you would implement a DB connection Pool, from which
      you would be taking out a DB connection before you need access to the Database, then use that
      DB connection to get a TDataSet containing selected records, copy that TDataSet contents into
      a TRtcDataSet (for example, using the "DelphiDataSetToRTC" function), then release the TDataSet
      received from the Database and return the DB connection back to the Database connection Pool,
      so it can be used again later. By doing that, you will be able to make the Server Multi-Threaded
      and scale under different loads, without losing too much time opening and closing DB connections.

      Here is a pseudo-code example for working with a Database connection Pool:

      MyDBConnection := Get_Connection_From_DB_Pool();
      try
        MyQuery := Execute_Query( MyDBConnection, MyQueryParameters );
        try
          DelphiDataSetToRTC( MyQuery, Result.newDataSet );
        finally
          Release_Query(MyQuery);
          end;
      finally
        Put_Connetion_To_DB_Pool(MyDBConnection);
        end; }

    // We will execute a SELECT statement on the Database to get the complete biolife table
    Query1.SQL.Text:='SELECT * FROM biolife';
    mSQL.Text:=Query1.SQL.Text; // Copy the SQL text into the Memo, as a simple monitoring option
    Query1.Active:=True;
    try
      // And then, we will copy the received dataset into a new TRtcDataSet inside our "Result" object
      DelphiDataSetToRtc(Query1, Result.NewDataSet); // This function is in the "rtcDB" unit
    finally
      Query1.Active:=False; // Close the dataset
      end;
    end
  else
    raise Exception.Create('Table "'+Param.asText['table']+'" not found on this Server.');
  end;

{ This function works with the TQuery component (BDE) and can be used
  to prepare the SQL statement and populate all required field values
  for executing the current Action from the "chg:TRtcDataSetChagnes" object.

  This is the most complex part in this whole example project,
  becuse it has to execute 3 different operations: INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE
  by using the Action attribute and information about OLD and NEW ROW content.

  Even though most developers will NOT want to use the BDE from their Servers,
  this example can be used as a "template" for implementing a similar function
  which would work with any other set of components for direct Database Access.

  This function also demonstrates the level of control you have on the Server
  when executing Actions receied from the Client. While some Databases might
  have full support for executing some actions using SQL, others may not.
  And because the Server is the one generating the SQL, it can customize
  the SQL statements to suit the needs of a Database, making sure that
  the same Client can work with any Database in the back-end.

  After this function completes, provided there were no exceptions raised,
  we only need to call "ExecSQL" method to execute the INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE action. }

  { For what ever reason, the BDE has a problem if field names
    after INSERT or SET are enclosed in double quotes, but when using '<tablename>.'
    as prefix, the problem with double quotes around field names disapears.

    BLOB and FLOAT fields inside WHERE clause also seem to cause problems for the BDE.
    BLOB fields don't seem to be supported at all for the WHERE clause,
    while FLOAT fields are supported but are unreliable because of precision loss.

    This is why we will NOT be using BLOB fields at all for the WHERE clause
    in this example, while FLOATS will ONLY be used if they have no fractional part.
    Other Databases or Database Access components might NOT have these problems. }

      Using the TRtcDataSetChanges instance will allow us to enumerate through
      all actions performed by the Client and decide what to do with them here.

      In a real Database Server Application, you should have a Database Connection
      Pool from which you would get a Database connection object before doing
      anything with the Database, create the Query component dinamically, work
      with that Query object in the loop (below) to execute requested actions
      on the Database, then release the Query object and return the Database
      Connection back to your Database Connection Pool.

      But since this is a very simple single-threaded BDE example, we will
      just be using the "TQuery" component from our Main Form.

      The part for preparing the SQL statement and execute requested actions
      (INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE) is identical in both situations, so this
      example could easily be extended to a real Database Server Application. }
