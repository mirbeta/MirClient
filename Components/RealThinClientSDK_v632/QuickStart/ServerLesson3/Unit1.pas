{ Quick-Start: RTC Server Lesson 3

Here is how you can create a new project, just like this one ...

Let's say we want to write a simple Web Server, which will provider access
to small files in a specific folder.

1. Open the Project created in Lesson 1 or Lesson 2 (either one will do).
2. from "RTC Server" tab, put a new RtcDataProvider on your form:
3. for RtcDataProvider3, set Server = RtcHttpServer1
4. for RtcDataProvider3, set CheckOrder = 900

Note: We want to send a file out ONLY if other data providers didn't accept
      the request. To achieve this, we have defined our place in the check
      order using the CheckOrder property. Our assumption here is that
      all other RtcDataProvider components have a lower CheckOrder.

5. We need a function to convert our Request.FileName
   to a local file name. All files are in a sub-folder
   "/data", placed in the same folder as our server app.

   Copy this function into your main form's unit:

  function GetFullFileName(fname:string):string;
    var
      DocRoot:string;
    begin
    // Get the executable file's folder name ...
    DocRoot:=ExtractFilePath(AppFileName);
    // Make sure the file doesn't end with '\' ...
    if Copy(DocRoot,length(DocRoot),1)='\' then
      Delete(DocRoot,length(DocRoot),1);
    // We want to use a sub-folder named '\data' ...
    DocRoot:=DocRoot+'\data';
    // Requests use "/" instead of "\" ...
    fname:=StringReplace(fname,'/','\',[rfreplaceall]);
    // Create file name containing full path
    Result:=ExpandFileName(DocRoot+fname);
    // Check if the file is inside our folder
    // (don't want people to use "..\" to
    //  move out of this folder)
    if UpperCase(Copy(Result,1,length(DocRoot)))<>
       UpperCase(DocRoot) then
      Result:=''; // return empty file name.
    end;

6. for RtcDataProvider3, define the OnCheckRequest event:

  var
    fname:string;
  begin
  with TRtcDataServer(Sender) do
    begin
    // This time, we will accept any Request for which we can find
    //  a file in our folder, specified in "Request.FileName"
    fname:=GetFullFileName(Request.FileName);
    if (fname<>'') and (File_Exists(fname)) then
      begin
      Accept;
      // We will store the file name in our request,
      //  so we don't have to recreate it again later.
      Request.Info['fname']:=fname;
      end;
    end;
  end;

7. We assume that the files will be short
   and we will be sending them out in one run.
   In that case, we can simply send the whole
   file out from our OnDataReceived event.

   For RtcDataProvider3, define the OnDataReceived event:

  var
    fname:string;
  begin
  with TRtcDataServer(Sender) do
    if Request.Complete then
      begin
      fname:=Request.Info['fname'];
      if File_Exists(fname) then
        Write(Read_File(fname))
      else
        // 'Write' will ensure that
        //  response is sent, even if empty.
        Write;
      end;
  end;

8. Compile and Run the Project.

This lesson got a bit complicated, because I wanted to use a folder relative
to our exe file and there has to be some file handling so clients don't get
access to our whole drive. To test how the server works, use Windows Explorer
to create a sub-folder named 'data' inside the folder where your project's
executable file is created, then put a file named 'test.txt' there. Once you
have the folder with a file and the server is running, open your Internet
Browser and download the file, using this link:
http://localhost/test.txt

If everything went ok, you should get the file in your Browser window.
If you place other files in the 'data' folder, you can download them by
using their name. It makes no difference whether the file is a text file,
image or an executable file.

I assumed that the file is small enough to be read in one call and sent
out directly, without splitting the thing in multiple events.
With larger files, there is a small modification we will have to do.
I will come to this in the next lesson.
