initialization
{ We will register a global constructor for our File Server class,
  allowing remote clients to create a File Server instance on demand.

  This is ONLY required if we want to allow the Client to create "File Server" instances remotely.
  If "TloFileServer" instances will ONLY be created manually on the Server side,
  there is no need to register a global constructor for our "TloFileServer" class.

  An alternative to using RegisterRtcObjectConstructor and registering a global
  constructor is to implement the "OnObjectCreate" event on the TRtcServerModule
  component, but that only works if we are using a TRtcServerModule for communication.
  And this particular demo is designed to work with TRtcLocalObjectManager as well. }
