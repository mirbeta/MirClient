    { ProcessMessage need to be called *only* once per request, with a complete request data 
      waiting in the "aRequest" stream and an empty "aReply" stream to receive the response.
      Request processing is done in a "blocking mode", which means that the caller will
      have the complete response filled in the "aReply" stream, before the call returns. }
