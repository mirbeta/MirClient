  Server connection component for UDP communication using raw data.

  { @Abstract(Server Connection component for UDP communication using raw data)

    There is no predefined formatting when sending and receiving
    data through @Link(TRtcUdpServer) connection component.
    Everything that comes through the connection, will be
    received exactly as it was sent (byte-wise). The same goes
    for sending data out through the component. This makes the
    component universal, so it can be used to write virtualy
    any UDP Server application.
    @html(<br><br>)

    There are BIG differences between the UDP Server component
    and the TCP/IP Server connection components:
    @html(<br><br>)

    1. UDP protocol is connectionless and all datagrams are received
    and accepted by the TRtcUdpServer component itself, without triggering
    events like OnConnect and without creating a separate connection
    component for the 'client connection'. Treat each Datagram as a
    separate connection. Simply read the datagram and reply to the
    client, if required. After each received Datagram, TRtcUdpServer
    will be prepared for sending to the client from which the last
    datagram was received. This makes it easy for you to send the
    answer datagram to the correct client. You can only send ONE (1)
    datagram as the answer to one received datagram.
    @html(<br><br>)

    2. UDP server is processing everything in a single thread,
    even when you use the MultiThreaded mode. The only difference in
    MultiThreaded mode with UDP is that processing will be done in
    a background thread, not the Main Thread. This means that, when
    using MultiThreaded mode, the Main Thread will not be blocked
    if UDP servers needs longer to process one UDP datagram. But,
    only one datagram can be processed at a time by one UDP Server
    and there is only ONE component that does all the processing.
    @html(<br><br>)

    3. Since there is no connection kept open after one UDP client
    sends a datagram to the UDP Server, your server can only respond
    to each datagram with one 'returning' datagram. But, UDP server
    can not send a serie of datagrams to the same client, without
    receiving a serie of datagrams from that UDP Client.

    Properties to check first:
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcConnection.ServerAddr) - Local Address to bind the server to (leave empty for ALL)
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcConnection.ServerPort) - Port to listen on and wait for connections
    @html(<br><br>)

    Methods to check first:
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcServer.Listen) - Start server
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcConnection.Read) - Read datagram
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcConnection.Write) - Write datagram (reply)
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcServer.StopListen) - Stop server
    @html(<br><br>)

    Envents to check first:
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcServer.OnListenStart) - Server started
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcConnection.OnDataReceived) - Datagram received (need to read)
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcConnection.OnDataSent) - Datagram sent (buffer now empty)
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcServer.OnListenStop) - Server stopped
    @html(<br><br>)

    @html(<b>function ReadEx:RtcByteArray;</b><br>)
      Use ReadEx to get the next UDP Datagram that is waiting
      for you in this connection component's receiving buffer.
      A call to Read will also clear the buffer, which means that
      you have to store the RtcByteArray received from ReadEx, before
      you start to process it.
      @html(<br><br>)

      When using UDP, data is received in datagrams (data packages).
      This means that your server will receive one OnDataReceived event
      for every datagram (data package) sent out by clients. Datagrams
      will also be read in one peace (not sliced as with TCP/IP)
      when using the @Link(TRtcConnection.Read) function.
      This makes the UDP protocol easier to use for simple message
      communication that TCP/IP. But, by using UDP, there is no guarantee
      that a datagram will be sent. It could be that you will be notified
      with OnDataLost event when your datagram doesnt reach the destination,
      but it could also be that you will not be notified at all and
      the datagram will simply be lost.
      @html(<br><br>)

      IMPORTANT: ONLY CALL Read from OnDataReceived event handler.
      OnDataReceived will be automatically triggered by the server connection
      component, every time new datagram becomes available.
      @html(<br><br>)

    @html(<b>procedure WriteEx(const s:RtcByteArray);</b><br>)
      Use WriteEx to send one datagram out. Write for UDP will put the
      datagram RtcByteArray into the sending buffer and return immediatelly.
      @html(<br><br>)

      There is a limit to the maximum size of a datagram, which differs
      from system to system. In case your datagram doesn't fit in this
      UDP sending buffer, an exception will be raised from Write.

    Check @Link(TRtcServer) and @Link(TRtcConnection) for more info.

      Be careful when changing this property, because it could easily happen

      to send data out, even though you can start sending data directly
      from the @Link(TRtcConnection.OnConnect) event.
      @html(<br><br>)

      By responding to this event and sending the data only after it was
      triggered, you avoid keeping the data in the send buffer, especially
      if the data you are sending is being read from a file on disk,
      which wouldn't occupy any memory until loaded. }

      exactly how much of it is on the way, use the @Link(TRtcConnection.DataOut) property.
      @html(<br><br>)

      NOTE: Even though data has been sent out, it doesn't mean that
      the other side already received it. It could also be that connection will
      break before this package reaches the other end. }

      has been sent out and the sending buffer has become empty again.
      @html(<br><br>)

      When sending large data blocks, try slicing them in small chunks,
      sending a chunk at a time and responding to this event to prepare
      and send the next chunk. This will keep your memory needs low. }
    property OnDataSent;
    { When this event triggers, it means that the other side has sent you

      likely not function over internet, but it does work in some LANs.
      @html(<br><br>)

      If you have to be 100% sure that your datagrams reached the destination,
      your destination should reply to each datagram and you should set
      a timeout to disconnect after X seconds if there is no reply AfterDataSent.
      Check the @Link(TRtcConnection.Timeout) property for more information
      on defining timeouts for a connection. }
