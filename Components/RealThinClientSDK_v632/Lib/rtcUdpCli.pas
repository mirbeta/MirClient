    There is no predefined formatting when sending and receiving
    data through @Link(TRtcUdpClient) connection component.
    Everything that comes through the connection, will be
    received exactly as it was sent (byte-wise). The same goes
    for sending data out through the component. This makes the
    component universal, so it can be used to write virtualy
    any UDP Client application.

    Properties to check first:
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcConnection.ServerAddr) - Address to connect to
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcConnection.ServerPort) - Port to connect to
    @html(<br><br>)

    Methods to check first:
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcClient.Connect) - Connect to server
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcConnection.Write) - Write datagram (send request to server)
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcConnection.Read) - Read datagram (get result from server)
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcConnection.Disconnect) - Disconnect from server
    @html(<br><br>)

    Events to check first:
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcConnection.OnConnect) - Connected to server
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcConnection.OnDataSent) - Datagram sent (buffer now empty)
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcConnection.OnDataReceived) - Datagram received (need to read)
    @html(<br>)
    @Link(TRtcConnection.OnDisconnect) - Disconnected from server
    @html(<br><br>)

    @html(<b>function ReadEx:RtcByteArray;</b><br>)
      Use ReadEx to get the next UDP Datagram that is waiting
      for you in this connection component's receiving buffer.
      A call to Read will also clear the buffer, which means that
      you have to store the RtcString received from Read, before
      you start to process it.
      @html(<br><br>)

      When using UDP, data is received in datagrams (data packages).
      This means that the client will receive one OnDataReceived event
      for every datagram (data package) sent out by server. Datagrams
      will also be read in one peace (not sliced as with TCP/IP)
      when using the @Link(TRtcConnection.Read) function.
      This makes the UDP protocol easier to use for simple message
      communication that TCP/IP. But, by using UDP, there is no guarantee
      that a datagram will be sent. It could be that you will be notified
      with OnDataLost event when your datagram doesnt reach the destination,
      but it could also be that you will not be notified at all and
      the datagram will simply be lost.
      @html(<br><br>)

      IMPORTANT: ONLY CALL Read from OnDataReceived event handler.
      OnDataReceived will be automatically triggered by the connection
      component, every time new datagram becomes available.
      @html(<br><br>)

    @html(<b>procedure WriteEx(const s:RtcByteArray);</b><br>)
      Use WriteEx to send one datagram out. Write for UDP will put the
      datagram RtcString into the sending buffer and return immediatelly.
      @html(<br><br>)

      There is a limit to the maximum size of a datagram, which differs
      from system to system. In case your datagram doesn't fit in this
      UDP sending buffer, an exception will be raised from Write.
      @html(<br><br>)

    Check @Link(TRtcClient) and @Link(TRtcConnection) for more info.

      from the @Link(TRtcConnection.OnConnect) event.
      @html(<br><br>)

      By responding to this event and sending the data only after it was
      triggered, you avoid keeping the data in the send buffer, especially
      if the data you are sending is being read from a file on disk,
      which wouldn't occupy any memory until loaded. }

      exactly how much of it is on the way, use the @Link(TRtcConnection.DataOut) property.
      @html(<br><br>)

      NOTE: Even though data has been sent out, it doesn't mean that
      the other side already received it. It could also be that connection will
      break before this package reaches the other end. }

      has been sent out and the sending buffer has become empty again.
      @html(<br><br>)

      When sending large data blocks, try slicing them in small chunks,
      sending a chunk at a time and responding to this event to prepare
      and send the next chunk. This will keep your memory needs low. }
    property OnDataSent;
    { When this event triggers, it means that the other side has sent you
      some data and you can now read it. Check the connection component's
      description to see which properties and methods you can use
      to read the data received. }

      and your UDP connection provider receives a notification from
      that the datagram could not be sent. This notification will most
      likely not function over internet, but it does work in some LANs.
      @html(<br><br>)

      If you have to be 100% sure that your datagrams reached the destination,
      your destination should reply to each datagram and you should set
      a timeout to disconnect after X seconds if there is no reply AfterDataSent.
      Check the @Link(TRtcConnection.Timeout) property for more information
      on defining timeouts for a connection. }
