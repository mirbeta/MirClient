This demo is based on the Loan Calculator module shipped as part of the Realtor World compiled demo available at https://go.devexpress.com/DevExpressDownload_VCLDemos.aspx.

The demo does the following:

 - Designates TMonthlyPayment and TYearlyPayment as storage classes for monthly and yearly loan payments;

 - Calls the entity manager's RegisterEntity function to register these classes as entity classes;

 - Enables simplified table and column mapping for the classes via the Automapping function;

 - Stores calculated payments to object lists (TObjectList<TMonthlyPayment> and TObjectList<TYearlyPayment>);

 - Loads data from the object lists to the TdxEMFDataSet components;

 - Binds the TdxEMFDataSet components to the Table and Chart grid Views;

 - Unregisters the entity classes in the form's destructor.
