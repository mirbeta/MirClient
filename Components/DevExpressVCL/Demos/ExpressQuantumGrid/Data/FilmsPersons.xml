low-budget films on a tight schedule), Roger Corman attempted to break into films by the tried and trusted method of working as a messenger for 20th-Century Fox, eventually rising to the position of story analyst. He started direct involvement in films in 1953 as a producer and screenwriter, making his debut as director in 1955. Between then and his official retirement in 1971 he directed dozens of films, often as many as six or seven per year, typically shot extremely quickly on leftover sets from other, larger, productions. His probably unbeatable record for a professional 35mm feature film was two days and a night to shoot the original version of The Little Shop of Horrors (1960), though several other films were made in less than a week. In the early 1960s, his budgets got bigger (though never big), when he made a series of adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe stories starring Vincent Price. Apart from Frankenstein Unbound (1990), he retired from directing in 1971 to concentrate on production and distribution through his company New World (and later Concorde), making low-budget exploitation films and using the profits to distribute distinguished art films. Apart from making dozens of enormously entertaining films (there are amazingly few duds in his output), Corman&apos;s place in film history is assured simply through his unrivalled eye for talent - among many world-class names who were employed by him at a very early stage in their careers are Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme, James Cameron, Peter Bogdanovich, Joe Dante and many others - which means that his influence on modern American cinema is almost incalculable."

His maternal grandfather was a famous operatic tenor, Julius Salomon (who died of tuberculosis in the 1880s). His father was a salesman of ladies unmentionables who left the family while Henry was at a young age, leaving him to support the family. He still managed to finish gymnasium (high school) in Berlin while working as a short-story writer and cartoonist. He was introduced to movies in 1910 when his Uncle Richard opened a movie theater in Berlin and his mother went there every day to play the piano to accompany the films. Henry went with her, day care being nonexistent then, and he had to sit for a couple of hours a day staring at the movie screen. He achieved success as a short-story writer at age 17, resulting in his being hired by a Berlin movie company as a scenarist. He became an assistant to director Curtis Bernhardt. Bernhardt became sick one day and asked Henry to direct (this was around 1931 or 1932). He had directed two films in Berlin for Aafa when Adolf Hitler came to power. He was in the midst of directing a film, DAS HASSLICHE MADCHEN, at that point, and having already been the victim of anti-Semitism, he knew he had to leave Germany, and soon. Any hesitation he may have had about leaving the country was erased when, at a bank on his lunch hour one day, a Nazi SA officer insulted him, and Henry hit the Nazi so hard he knocked him out. He proceeded to go directly to the railroad station and took a train for France. Upon arriving in France he was rehired by Bernhardt (who had left earlier). Eventually Henry went to Budapest and met and married Kato Kiraly (1934). It was there he met producer Joe Pasternak, who represented Universal Pictures in Europe, and directed four films for him.&#013;&#010;In 1950 he directed what was his biggest success to date, the James Stewart comedy Harvey (1950), but, although many in the industry thought it would be nominated for Best Picture, it wasn&apos;t. He directed the first American film in which Richard Burton appeared, My Cousin Rachel (1952), then was assigned by 20th Century-Fox to direct its first CinemaScope picture, The Robe (1953), also with Burton, which was a tremendous success. He directed a few more costume dramas, such as Desiree (1954) with Marlon Brando, then went back to family comedies and musicals, such as Flower Drum Song (1961) for Universal. After he finished The Singing Nun (1966) he retired from the film business to Leisure Village, Camarillo, California, to indulge his lifelong interest in painting.

His father had studied singing and young Gene displayed an early interest in drama and music. Shortly after the 7-year-old danced a Highland fling in a concert given by the 48th Highlanders&apos; Regimental Band, his father joined the band as a Scottish tenor. The Lockhart family accompanied the band to England. While his father toured, Gene studied at the Brompton Oratory School in London. When they returned to Canada, Gene began singing in concert, often on the same program with Beatrice Lillie. His mother encouraged his career, urging him to try for a part on Broadway. Lockhart went to America. At 25, he got a part in a New York play in September, 1917, as Gustave in Klaw and Erlanger&apos;s musical &quot;The Riviera Girl.&quot; Between acting engagements, he wrote for the stage. His first production was &quot;The Pierrot Players&quot; for which he wrote both book and lyrics and played. It toured Canada in 1919 and introduced &quot;The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise&quot; (words by Lockhart, music by Ernest Seitz), which became a very popular ballad.. &quot;Heigh-Ho&quot; (1920) followed, a musical fantasy with score by Deems Taylor and book and lyrics by Lockhart. It had a short run (again, with him in the cast). Lockhart&apos;s first real break as a dramatic actor came in the supporting role of Bud, a mountaineer moonshiner, in Lula Vollmer&apos;s Sun Up (1939) (TV). This was an American folk play, first presented by The Players, a theatrical club, in a Greenwich Village little theater in 1923. After great notices it moved to a larger house for a two-year run. During this engagement, in 1924 at the age of 33, Lockhart married Kathleen Lockhart (aka Kathleen Arthur), an English actress and musician. Gene meanwhile also appeared in a series of performances presented by The Players in New York theaters: as Gregoire in &quot;The Little Father of the Wilderness&quot;; as Waitwell in &quot;The Way of the World,&quot; as Gumption Cute in &quot;Uncle Tom&apos;s Cabin&quot;, and as Faust in &quot;Mephisto.&quot; The Lockharts&apos; daughter, June Lockhart, was born in 1925. She would eventually appear regularly in the television series &quot;Lassie&quot; (1954) and &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (1965). In 1933, Gene and Kathleen were featured in &quot;Sunday Night at Nine,&quot; a radio program presented at New York&apos;s Barbizon-Plaza Hotel. Meanwhile, Lockhart was keeping busy writing articles for theatrical magazines and a weekly column for a Canadian publication, coaching members of New York&apos;s Junior League in dramatics, lecturing on dramatic technique at the Julliard School of Music, and directing a revival of &quot;The Warrior&apos;s Husband&quot;--a formidable schedule. It amused him as he said that, &quot;in spite of [the amount of work in a typical day] I don&apos;t get thin.&quot; Lockhart had by this time taken on the appearance that audiences would see again and again in films--short and plump with a chubby, jowly face and twinkling blue eyes. In 1933, he played Uncle Sid in the Theatre Guild&apos;s production of Eugene O&apos;Neill&apos;s comedy &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot; co-starring George M. Cohan. This was the role that was to bring Lockhart stardom and lead to a contract with RKO Pictures and his first film, By Your Leave (1934). O&apos;Neill wrote to Lockhart: &quot;Every time your Sid has come in for dinner I&apos;ve wanted to burst into song, and every time you&apos;ve come down from that nap I&apos;ve felt the cold gray ghost of an old heebie-jeebie.&quot; The acclaim for his acting in &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot; allowed Lockhart to proceed to Hollywood and remain there almost without interruption. However, he was back on Broadway in December, 1949, when he took over the part of Willy Loman in the New York production of &quot;Death of a Salesman.&quot; Lockhart appeared in over 125 films. Though he often played upright doctors, judges and businessmen, and was in real life described as an amiable and gentle soul, Lockhart is perhaps best remembered on film as a villain who usually ends up cowering in a corner whimpering pitifully before getting his just desserts, a scene he played to the hilt in such movies as Algiers (1938) (for which he was nominated for an Oscar), Blackmail (1939), Geronimo (1939), Northern Pursuit (1943), and Hangmen Also Die! (1943). Late on Saturday, March 30, 1957, Lockhart suffered a heart attack while sleeping in his apartment at 10439 Ashton Avenue in West Los Angeles. He was taken to St. John&apos;s Hospital and died on Sunday afternoon, March 31. He is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery."

Unlike many child actors, her film career continued as a teenager, and as a blue-eyed blonde, Anita became a star in Warner Brothers costume dramas such as Madame Du Barry (1934), A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream (1935), The Story of Louis Pasteur (1935), and Marie Antoinette (1938).

Griffith&apos;s mother and grandmother were in a famous radio show called, &quot;Myrt and Marge&quot; which went to New York and became a soap opera. After Griffith left the army he came out to California to live with his grandmother Myrte Vail. Before he started writing scripts, Griffith and his cousin Ron Fellows were in a stage act with famous movie and stage comedians Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson called, &quot;Tsk Tsk Pare!&quot;. Later he tried his hand at writing, his first attempt was a proposed television version of &quot;Myrt and Marge&quot;. Griffith met and became good friends with actor Johnathan Haze, who had just started out working for prolific director Roger Corman in the film, Monster From The Ocean Floor (1954). Wanting to help his friend break into movies, John took several of Griffith&apos;s scripts and put them right down on Corman&apos;s desk. Corman liked the scripts and hired him. On Griffith&apos;s third script, Corman was able to make this script into the movie, Gunslinger (1956) starring Beverly Garland and John Ireland. His next movie for Corman became a sci-fi cult classic, It Conquered The World (1956). He not only wrote his films but he also acted in some of them and was an assistant director for many. In It Conquered The World, he was Dr. Pete Shelton. Later he wrote The Undead (1957) for Corman...... a fascinating journey into reincarnation. Originally written in iambic pentameter, Griffith had to translate it back into English. Starring Pamela Duncan, Richard Garland, and Allison Hayes - who appeared in three of Griffith&apos;s films and later appeared in &quot;The Attack Of The 50 Woman!&quot; With this film Hayes achieved &quot;cult-status&quot; among the sci-fi fans.&#013;&#010;Probably Griffith&apos;s best known film was the low-budget classic hit, The Little Shop Of Horrors (1960). Shot in three days this horror/comedy starred, Johnathan Haze as Seymour Krelboin and Jackie Joseph as Audrey. Haze as Seymour delivered a magnificent performance in his role. This film was such a very popular cult movie that it later became a Broadway play and the movie was remade. Griffith had four parts in the film: he was the voice of the plant Audrey 2......&quot;feed meeee!&quot;, a shadow on the wall in an alley, a man running out of the dentist office and he was the robber who holds up flowershop proprietor Mel Wells only to be eaten alive by Audrey 2! Griffith and Mel Wells shot exteriors on this film on location in &quot;Skid Row&quot;. Griffith wrote many more films, another cult-classic is his film, Death Race 2000 (1974). This film also has a large following and the original story was written by Ib Melchior and the screenplay was written by Griffith. Griffith also appeared at movie memorablia shows on the west coast, but he only appeared at &quot;one&quot; show on the east coast in March 2007 in Ohio.

Had Edward D. Wood been born a decade or so earlier it&apos;s easy to imagine him working out of some poverty row outfit in Gower Gulch, competing with the likes of Victor Adamson, Robert J. Horner and Dwain Esper for the title of all-time hack. He would&apos;ve fit in nicely at Educational Pictures in the early 30&apos;s or PRC in the following decade. But Wood, like everyone, is imprisoned in their own time, and in the 1950&apos;s Edward D. Wood Jr. simply had no competition. Edward D. Wood Jr. was ignored throughout a spectacularly unsuccessful career, died a penniless alcoholic, only to be &quot;rediscovered&quot; when promoters in the early 1980s tagged him the worst director of all time (mostly thanks to the Medveds&apos; hilarious book, &quot;Golden Turkey Awards&quot;)- and was given the singular honor of a full-length biopic by Tim Burton. This post-mortem fame has made him infinitely more famous today than he ever was when alive. On a personal level, Wood was exceedingly complex; by all accounts he was an exemplary soldier, wounded in ferocious combat in the Pacific theater in WW II. Conversely, he claimed to have been wearing a bra and panties under his uniform during a military landing. He was habitually optimistic, even in the face of the bleak realities that would later consume him. His personality bonded him with a small clique of outcasts that eked out life on the Hollywood fringe. Wood attempted to break into the film industry, initially without success, but finally landing the chance to direct a film based on the real-life Christine Jorgensen sex-change story, then a hot topic. The result, Glen or Glenda (1953) gave a fascinating insight into Wood&apos;s own personality and shed light on his transvestism (an almost unthinkable subject for an early 1950s feature). Although devoutly heterosexual, Wood was an enthusiastic cross-dresser, with a particular fondness for angora. On the debit side, though, the film revealed an almost total lack of talent that would mar all his subsequent films, his tendency to resort to stock footage of lightning during dramatic moments, laughable set design, and a near-incomprehensible performance by Bela Lugosi, as a mad doctor, whose presence is never adequately explained. The film deservingly flopped miserably but Wood, always upbeat, pressed ahead. Friends described him as far more interested in the work required in cobbling a project together than learning the craft of filmmaking. In an alternate universe Wood might have been a competent producer had he had better industry connections and hired a competent director. Wood however, likened himself to his idol, Orson Welles, and became a triple threat: bad producer, poor screenwriter and god-awful director. All of his films exhibit illogical continuity, bizarre narratives and give the distinct impression that a director&apos;s job was simply to expose the least amount of film possible due to constant budget constraints. Visible wires connected to pie-pan UFOs, actors knocking over cardboard headstones, cars changing models and years during chase sequences, scenes exhibiting a disturbing lack of handgun safety, and the ingenious use of shower curtains in rudder-less airplane cockpits are just a few of the trademarks of an Edward D. Wood Jr. production. When criticized for their innumerable flaws, he&apos;d cheerfully explain his interpretation of the suspension of disbelief. It&apos;s not so much that he made movies so badly, the amazing part is that he managed to get them made at all. His subsequent film with Lugosi, Bride of the Monster (1955) was no better, and Wood only shot a few seconds of silent footage of Lugosi (dazed, wandering around his front yard) for his next film, Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959) before the actor died. Unbelievably, it somehow managed to earn a small profit during it&apos;s original release, undoubtedly more of a testament to how cheaply it was produced than as entertainment. What few reviews the film received were awful. Typically undaunted, Wood based his Plan 9 around this limited material and microscopic budget, casting it with his regular band of mostly inept actors. Given the level of dialog, budget and Wood&apos;s dismal directorial abilities, it&apos;s unlikely that better actors would have been an improvement - in fact, it&apos;s &quot;Plan 9&quot;&apos;s semi-official status as arguably the Worst Film Ever Made that gives it its substantial cult following. The film, financed by a local Baptist congregation led by Wood&apos;s landlord, reaches a plateau of gross ineptitude that leaves viewers stunned. Plan 9 became his singular enduring legacy. Ironically, the rights to the film were retained by the church and it is unlikely that Wood ever realized a dime from it; his epic bombed upon release and remained largely forgotten for years to come. After this career &quot;peak,&quot; Wood went into decline (using relative terms). Always a enthusiastic drinker, his alcohol addiction worsened in the 1960&apos;s. Wood directed undistinguished soft and later hardcore pornography under the name &quot;Akdov Telmig&quot; (it helps to imagine you&apos;re a boozy dyslexic), and writing a number of transvestite-themed pornographic paperbacks into the 1970&apos;s. His final years were spent largely drunk in his apartment and occasionally being rolled stumbling out of a local liquor store. Wood and his wife were evicted from their apartment shortly before his premature death at 54. Due to his recent resurgence in popularity, many of his equally bizarre transvestite-themed sex novels have been republished. The gravitational pull of Planet Angora remains quite strong."

He was the son of a mill worker, and studied for a career in architecture which he indeed began. But with World War I he left his position to join the British army. After the war he set his sights in a different direction, training to become an actor by attending the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. His first stage play was in 1921. He honed his skills thereafter (from 1922 to 1939) principally as a Shakespearian actor at the Old Vic in London or at Stratford-upon-Avon - and later the Open Air in Regent&apos;s Park. But by 1930 he was giving time to films as well. His first movie was the Sean O&apos;Casey play Juno and the Paycock (1930), one of Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s early sound efforts. With his craggy profile and arcing bulbous nose, and rather stern visage (though it could as quickly break into a broad smile), he was right for many a memorable character. Hitchcock made sure of that first off by calling on him again to play the dour, suspicious, and miserly farmer, John Crofter, in The 39 Steps (1935). Laurie became a good friend of another Shakespearean, Laurence Olivier, and the two, Olivier as a lead, were in Hungarian director/producer Paul Czinner&apos;s As You Like It (1936). The year 1937 was a busy one, with six films, the most important giving him one of his few leading roles. This was director/screen writer Michael Powell&apos;s intriguing The Edge of the World (1937), doubly important in that it was the film that sold Powell to producers like Alexander Korda. The film was shot on location on the remote Shetland isle of Foula, the furthest point of Britain. It dealt with the impact of the modern world on the lives of the inhabitants of an economically decaying island. Into 1938 and 1939 Laurie was involved in British experimental TV movies, that medium to be revisit later frequently. In 1939 he was taped by Alexander Korda for his classic film production of The Four Feathers (1939) in which Laurie, who could fit his Scots voice to any part, played the zealous Mahdi (the Khalifa). He is hardly to be recognized in character.&#013;&#010;Through the remainder of the decade and into the 1950s, Laurie&apos;s face showed up in a variety of films - with greater frequency as assorted Scotsmen-comedic an otherwise - and further down the credits list of supporting actors. He was familiar in the decade invasion to the UK of American co-productions, such as Disney&apos;s Treasure Island (1950) and Kidnapped (1960). And he even trod the uncertain path of a few sci-fi films - that shall remain nameless here. But he was certainly always busy - when all told - the actor&apos;s foremost blessing. Television drama and series gave him better opportunities for a veteran actor, beginning with a Henry V (1953) (TV) where he played the comic role of Pistol. Along with some BBC TV theater (more Shakespeare and some American playhouse as well) and sporadic serials, he had a stint on the long-running BBC children&apos;s reading program &quot;Jackanory&quot;. And he is probably best remembered as the dour James Frazer on the popular &quot;Dad&apos;s Army&quot; series (1968-1977).

He started direct involvement in films in 1953 as a producer and screenwriter, making his debut as director in 1955. Between then and his official retirement in 1971 he directed dozens of films, often as many as six or seven per year, typically shot extremely quickly on leftover sets from other, larger, productions. His probably unbeatable record for a professional 35mm feature film was two days and a night to shoot the original version of The Little Shop of Horrors (1960), though several other films were made in less than a week. In the early 1960s, his budgets got bigger (though never big), when he made a series of adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe stories starring Vincent Price. Apart from Frankenstein Unbound (1990), he retired from directing in 1971 to concentrate on production and distribution through his company New World (and later Concorde), making low-budget exploitation films and using the profits to distribute distinguished art films. Apart from making dozens of enormously entertaining films (there are amazingly few duds in his output), Corman&apos;s place in film history is assured simply through his unrivalled eye for talent - among many world-class names who were employed by him at a very early stage in their careers are Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme, James Cameron, Peter Bogdanovich, Joe Dante and many others - which means that his influence on modern American cinema is almost incalculable."

Of Irish and Cherokee Indian descent, he taught himself (by ear) the fiddle and guitar at a young age and started performing at local functions as a teen. In the late 1920s, Glenn and his cousin, Taylor McPeters, better known later as the western character actor Cactus Mack, joined a radio singing group known as the &quot;Arizona Wranglers&quot; that toured throughout the country.&#013;&#010;They both started providing singing fillers in film westerns in the early 1930s. Glenn would play extra or bit roles for a number of years -- whether a cowhand, rustler, henchman, sidekick, or plain ol&apos; warbling, harmonica-blowing cowboy. Eventually in the late 30s his billing improved and he evolved into a full-time bad guy in hundreds of &quot;B&quot; westerns. He was seen (or glimpsed) in many of the popular serials of the day, including The Hurricane Express (1932), The Law of the Wild (1934), Flash Gordon (1936/I), The Lone Ranger Rides Again (1939), and Riders of Death Valley (1941). It was his massive build that helped him break into the Universal horror picture genre of the 1940s. Horror star Boris Karloff had grown weary and fearful of his Frankenstein Creature typecast and abandoned the role. Glenn was the perfect replacement for the job and made his monstrous debut with House of Frankenstein (1944), quickly followed by House of Dracula (1945).

A blue-eyed, peroxide blonde sexpot who had a lot going for her, her life eventually disintegrated, mostly by her own doing. Things started out well enough for Barbara Lee Redfield, born on November 26, 1927, in Cloquet, Minnesota. From a modest, blue-collar background, she grew up to be a drop-dead gorgeous young woman and, following a quickie marriage at age 19, decided to leave home for good to try to capitalize on her good looks in Tinseltown. She headed for Hollywood in 1948 and, within a short time, was placed under contract by Universal, where she began the typical starlet route of bit parts. She reached her peak with routine but promising co-star work opposite James Cagney in Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye (1950), Gary Cooper in Dallas (1950) and Gregory Peck in Only the Valiant (1951). Although her talent (5) was overshadowed by her brassiness (10) and looks (10), her slightly lurid appeal seemed to be enough to carry her through. Caught up in the glitz and glamor, however, her career started taking second place to a reckless life full of capricious romances involving a number of top stars and producers, many of them married. One of her more famous trysts ended up making headlines for her, and none of them favorable. She was juggling two boyfriends at the same time, classy &quot;A&quot; actor Franchot Tone and muscular &quot;B&quot; actor Tom Neal, and they fought almost to the death for Barbara&apos;s affections. On September 13, 1951, the men engaged in a deadly brawl and when it was over, Tone was in the hospital with broken bones and a brain concussion. Barbara ended up with both a black eye and a tarnished reputation. She married Tone after he recovered, but left him after only seven weeks and returned to the violence-prone Neal. That abusive relationship lasted four years, though they never married. During that time Barbara&apos;s career had plummeted to the point where she was making such dismal features as Bride of the Gorilla (1951). She went to England to try to rejuvenate her career, but no dice; it was over and her life was skidding out of control. Her once beautiful face now blotchy and her once spectacular figure now bloated, Barbara sank deeper into the bottle. From 1955 to 1963 there were various brushes with the law - among them passing bad checks, public drunkenness and, ultimately, prostitution. She was forced to sleep on bus benches, was beaten and bruised by her tricks, and lost teeth in the process. In 1967, after failed efforts to curb her drinking, she finally moved in with her parents in San Diego to try to dry out. It was too late. On May 8, 1967, the 39-year-old former starlet was found on the bathroom floor - dead of heart and liver failure. Somehow through all this misery she managed a tell-all book ironically entitled &quot;I Am Not Ashamed&quot; (1963)."

His father managed a construction company. His mother, Pauline Schlesinger, was Jewish but converted to Catholicism when Lang was ten. After high school, he enrolled briefly at the Technische Hochschule Wien and then started to train as a painter. From 1910 to 1914, he traveled in Europe, and he would later claim, also in Asia and North Africa. He studied painting in Paris from 1913-14. At the start of World War I, he returned to Vienna, enlisting in the army in January 1915. Severely wounded in June 1916, he wrote some scenarios for films while convalescing. In early 1918, he was sent home shell-shocked and acted briefly in Viennese theater before accepting a job as a writer at Erich Pommer&apos;s production company in Berlin, Decla. In Berlin, Lang worked briefly as a writer and then as a director, at Ufa and then for Nero-Film, owned by the American Seymour Nebenzal. In 1920, he began a relationship with actress and writer Thea von Harbou (1889-1954), who wrote with him the scripts for his most celebrated films: Dr. Mabuse, der Spieler - Ein Bild der Zeit (1922), Die Nibelungen: Siegfried (1924), Metropolis (1927) and M (1931) (credited to von Harbou alone).

Lang--who was an anti-Nazi mainly because of his Catholic background--did not accept the position (it was later offered to and accepted by filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl and, after secretly sending most of his money out of the country, fled Germany to Paris. After about a year in Paris, Lang moved to the United States in mid-1934, initially under contract to MGM. Over the next 20 years, he directed numerous American films. In the 1950s, in part because the film industry was in economic decline and also because of Lang&apos;s long-standing reputation for being difficult with, and abusive to, actors, he found it increasingly hard to get work. At the end of the 1950s, he traveled to Germany and made what turned out to be his final three films there, none of which were well received.&#013;&#010;In 1964, nearly blind, he was chosen to be president of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival. He was an avid collector of primitive art and habitually wore a monocle, an affectation he picked up during his early days in Vienna. After his divorce from von Harbou, he had relationships with many other women, but from about 1931 to his death in 1976, he was close to Lily Latte, who helped him in many ways."

He was expelled from Phillips and joined the U.S. Naval Reserve. From 1920 to 1922, he managed a stage company owned by family friend William A. Brady (the father of actress Alice Brady), performing a variety of tasks at Brady&apos;s film studio in New York. He then began regular stage performances. Alexander Woollcott described his acting in a 1922 play as inadequate. In 1930, he gained a contract with Fox, his feature film debut in a ten-minute short, Broadway&apos;s Like That (1930), co-starring Ruth Etting and Joan Blondell. Fox released him after two years. After five years of stage and minor film roles, he had his breakthrough role in The Petrified Forest (1936) from Warner Bros. He won the part over Edward G. Robinson only after the star, Leslie Howard, threatened Warner Bros. that he would quit unless Bogart was given the key role of Duke Mantee, which he had played in the Broadway production with Howard. The film was a major success and led to a long-term contract with Warner Bros. From 1936 to 1940, Bogart appeared in 28 films, usually as a gangster, twice in Westerns and even a horror film. His landmark year was 1941 (often capitalizing on parts George Raft had stupidly rejected) with roles in classics such as High Sierra (1941) and as Sam Spade in one of his most fondly remembered films, The Maltese Falcon (1941). These were followed by Casablanca (1942), The Big Sleep (1946), and Key Largo (1948). Bogart, despite his erratic education, was incredibly well-read and he favored writers and intellectuals within his small circle of friends. In 1947, he joined wife Lauren Bacall and other actors protesting the House Un-American Activities Committee witch hunts. He also formed his own production company, and the next year made The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948). Bogie won the best actor Academy Award for The African Queen (1951) and was nominated for Casablanca (1942) and as Captain Queeg in The Caine Mutiny (1954), a film made when he was already seriously ill. He died in his sleep at his Hollywood home following surgeries and a battle with throat cancer."

Her parents ran a laundry in the city&apos;s Chinatown section. Anna became a photographer&apos;s model when she was still attending Hollywood High School. She was fascinated with the movie industry at a young age, having observed several films being shot in and around her neighborhood. When she was almost 14, her actor cousin, James Wong Howe, showed a photograph of her to a director, which resulted in her getting a bit part in Dinty (1920) (unfortunately for film buffs, there are no prints of the movie in existence, because of deterioration). The next year she appeared in two more films, Shame (1921) and Bits of Life (1921) (in which she received billing). Anna&apos;s big break came when she landed the role of a Mongol slave girl in The Thief of Bagdad (1924). This film put her in the position of being the first (and for a long time the only) Chinese-American to become a bona fide movie star. It led to bigger parts in other movies with a Chinese or Asian theme, in which she alternated between playing the heroine or the heroine&apos;s evil nemesis. Another hit for her was A Trip to Chinatown (1926), in which her trademark bangs and Oriental dress only accentuated her natural beauty, enhancing her status with the movie-going public. Before long her name was synonymous with exotic, Asian-themed productions, and films such as The Devil Dancer (1927), Across to Singapore (1928) and The Crimson City (1928) kept fans coming to the theaters. Anna&apos;s talent and beauty carried her through a successful transition into talkies, and she also traveled to Europe to make films there. Upon her return to the U.S. after three years, she was signed to a contract with Paramount. Her career reached its zenith with her casting in Shanghai Express (1932) with Marlene Dietrich. Another in her string of successes was Dangerous to Know (1938) with Charles Laughton, Lloyd Nolan and Anthony Quinn, in which she played Lin Yang, a &quot;kept&quot; woman who seeks revenge when her gangster lover tries to replace her. By the 1940s, however, Anna&apos;s career had begun to stall. Theater patrons were finding escapist fare elsewhere, and her Chinese melodramas were no longer in demand. Also, American society&apos;s attitudes towards races other than Caucasian made it almost impossible for Anna to get good parts in pictures other than Asian-themed ones. After Lady from Chungking (1942), Anna didn&apos;t appear on-screen again until Impact (1949), and then only in a minor supporting role. She had an early television series, &quot;The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong&quot; (1951), but it didn&apos;t last long. Anna appeared sporadically on television throughout the 1950s. Her career problems were exacerbated by a drinking problem, and by the mid-1950s she learned that she was suffering from heart problems and cirrhosis of the liver. She made a final effort to recharge her career with Portrait in Black (1960) and The Savage Innocents (1960). Although the first was a modest hit, the second film was released to mixed reviews and meager box office receipts. On February 2, 1961, Anna died of a heart attack in Santa Monica, California, at age 56. She had never married."

Falmouth was a small sleepy town then, as it is still today. He was one of 12 siblings who were moved to Lakeland, Florida sometime around WWI. Lakeland is where Dan was introduced into show business in 1922 at the age of 14. He ran away from home when the show moved on, and traveled thousands of miles throughout the South in tent, minstrel, vaudeville and theater shows. Dan performed on stage with his brother Willard for 9 years with a stock company in Tampa&apos;s old Rialto Theater. Actress Frances Langford worked with him during this time and it was Dan who told her to go to Hollywood. During this period he met Matilda &quot;Tilda&quot; Mae Spivey on the stage, and married her on February 25, 1933. Tilda had a 2-year-old child from a previous marriage by the name of Arthur &quot;Art&quot; Grant Gifford. Times were tough, so Dan had to get out of show business for a while to make some real money. In 1934 he found work with the Conservation Corps in Homestead, Florida, but show business was always in his heart. Dan knew he had what it took to &quot;make it&quot; in Hollywood, so he decided to make the move to California in 1935. They packed all their possessions into their Ford and started the long, arduous trek across the country. This was during the Great Depression, and money was very tight. They had to stop frequently in various cities across the country to make extra money to continue their journey. Dan was a very good auto mechanic and never had a problem finding this type of work wherever he went. This paid-off once during the filming of To Kill a Mockingbird (1962): During the &apos;mob&apos; scene, one of the cars they were to drive away in would not start. Dan opened the hood, stepped onto the front bumper, and had the car &apos;running&apos; in no time flat. They lived in Panama City, Florida and Shreveport, Louisiana for a while. By the time they reached Texarkana, Arkansas in January 1937, they had to stop for a different reason this time. Tilda was carrying their unborn child, and it was showing signs that it could wait no longer. Tilda&apos;s sister Mary happened to live in Texarkana, and they were able to stay there for a few months until the baby was born, and big enough to travel. Their daughter June Larue White was born February 14, 1937. On April 1, 1937, Dan, Tilda, Art and June continued their journey to Hollywood. They arrived 16 days later, and found a house to rent just an eyeshot away from the &quot;HOLLYWOOD&quot; sign. They lived in this house for 23 years where many movie deals were made, and scripts were written--right in their own living room! Upon arrival in Hollywood, Dan had a hard time finding work and found himself down in Panama working on the Pan American Highway for 6 months. When he returned home in 1938, he found work with Republic Pictures Corp. He made at least 6 movies with Republic in his first year alone. His first known film was a western titled Prairie Moon (1938) with Gene Autry. Dan made $55 a week working on this production. Over the years in Hollywood, Dan claimed to have made nearly 300 films, and 150 television appearances. About 70 percent of these were Westerns. Among his most well-known pictures were The Yearling (1946), Distant Drums (1951), Red River (1948), _To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)_, Giant (1956), Duel in the Sun (1946), _Four Faces West (1948)_, Jailhouse Rock (1957), Touch of Evil (1958) and many many more. Somehow during all this filming, Dan and Tilda found time to have their 3rd child--Donald Curtis White, born November 9, 1941; just 28 days before Pearl Harbor was bombed. Of course, the films that made him famous were his numerous appearances in B-western movies where he played the villain or henchie. His tough, high-cheekboned face with its tight-drawn, expressionless mouth and snake eyes chilled the blood of many a Saturday matinee-er in the &apos;40s and &apos;50s. Dan loved his work, especially all of his &quot;outdoor&quot; pictures. In the &apos;50s and &apos;60s when the films started to dry up, Dan turned to television. He was offered the role of Sam the Bartender in Gunsmoke, but he didn&apos;t want to commit to something like that. He told his best friend Glenn Strange to apply for the job, and the rest is history. Dan lived in California for almost 40 years, but his real love was Florida where he grew up. Upon his retirement, he returned home to Tampa, Florida just down the street from the old Rialto Theater where it all started. He made appearances in &quot;Western Film Round-UP&apos;s&quot; and television talk shows, and was frequently visited by his family in California until his death on July 7, 1980 at the age of 72. Dan left behind three children and 12 grandchildren. Not only will he be recognized and remembered for all his films, but he will also be remembered as a great father and grandfather.

His forte was light comedy, but he helmed many different types of pictures for the studio. Lubin was the director Universal entrusted with its new comedy team of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello; he didn&apos;t let the studio down, and the team&apos;s films with Lubin, such as Buck Privates (1941), Hold That Ghost (1941) and Ride &apos;Em Cowboy (1942), rank among their best. Lubin has said that while shooting an Abbott and Costello film he would have one camera do nothing but focus on Costello, who had so much energy that he would run around the set doing wild improvisations, make up bits of business and mischievously throw actors wrong cues or not cue them at all, making it impossible to plan a shot before shooting; with one camera focused solely on Costello, whatever craziness he was engaged in could be edited in (or out; Costello was renowned for his off-color ad libs) later. Lubin&apos;s Abbott &amp; Costello films saved Universal from bankruptcy, and as a reward he was handed the assignment of directing Universal&apos;s remake of its silent classic, Phantom of the Opera (1943). It was very successful, and remains as Lubin&apos;s highest-grossing and most critically acclaimed film. In the 1950s he was put in charge of the &quot;Francis the Talking Mule&quot; series, which also became successful, so much so that Lubin turned to television and developed another talking-animal series, the popular and long-running &quot;Mister Ed&quot; (1961)."

Charles Trowbridge was educated in Napa, California and Hawaii, then studied for his degree at Stanford University. He forsook a thriving career as an architect in his twenties for stage acting, receiving early training at the Alcazar Theatre in San Francisco with Bert Lytell and Bessie Barriscale. He then moved to New York where he earned a number of regional roles in the Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia areas before making his Broadway bow with &quot;The Marriage Game&quot; in 1913. He proceeded to build up his resume impressively with the plays &quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot; in 1914 and when it was revived in 1918, &quot;The Broken Wing (1920), &quot;Craig&apos;s Wife (1925), &quot;Ladies Leave&quot; (1929) and &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; (1933). He made a sampling of silents over the years as well, primarily in drama, with The Fight (1915), Thais (1917/I) and The Eternal Magdalene (1919) to name a few. After co-starring opposite Corinne Griffith in Island Wives (1922), however, he was not seen again for nearly a decade.&#013;&#010;After a steady diet of Broadway plays, he was signed by Paramount for character roles in sound pictures and proceeded to support the top stars. With his rangy build, piercing blue eyes, premature gray hair and serious countenance, Trowbridge was particularly useful throughout the 1930s and 1940s in crime yarns, horrors and in rugged settings starting out with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard in the romantic drama I Take This Woman (1931). Trowbridge usually adopted a friendly but intelligent, officious demeanor as assorted doctors, judges, bankers, lawyers, military brass and even U.S. presidents. He appeared rather indiscriminately in a number of &quot;A&quot; quality films including Captains Courageous (1937), Meet John Doe (1941), Sergeant York (1941) and Mildred Pierce (1945), and in popular cliffhangers such as King of the Texas Rangers (1941), Adventures of the Flying Cadets (1943) and Captain America (1944). He often played well-meaning victims who died in the first reel, notably in horrors. His last two films were unbilled bits, courtesy of John Ford, in The Wings of Eagles (1957) and The Last Hurrah (1958). Retired thereafter, Trowbridge passed away a number of years later at age 85."

He started his career in the US Army in 1918, as a lieutenant in the artillery conducting and directing parades. After the cease fire he was ordered to stage camp shows for the soldiers. Back in the US he became stage actor and assistant director in smaller acting troops. After being forced to take over the direction of the musical &quot;Holka-Polka&quot; he discovered his talent for staging extravagant dance routines, and he beamed as one of the top Broadway dance directors. Producer Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. called him to direct the dance routines for his production &quot;A Connecticut Yankee on King Arthur&apos;s Court&quot;. Eddie Cantor, who starred in the long running Ziegfeld production &quot;Whoopee!&quot; suggested Berkley create the dance routines in the film version, and Ziegfeld agreed. At first in Hollywood, he wasn&apos;t satisfied with the possibilities of his job - at the time, dance directors trained the dancers and staged the dances. The director chose the position for the cameras and the editor chose which of the takes were shown to the audience. Berkeley wanted to direct the dances himself and convinced the producer Samuel Goldwyn to let him try. One of the first chances he took was that he used only one camera in his films. He also showed close-ups of the chorus girls. Asked about this he explained: &quot;Well, we&apos;ve got all the beautiful girls in the picture, why not let the public see them?&quot; With the decline of musicals in 1931 and 1932, he was thinking of returning to Broadway, when Darryl F. Zanuck, chief producer at Warner Brothers called him in to direct the musicals numbers of their newest project, the backstage drama 42nd Street (1933). Berkeley accepted and directed great numbers like &quot;Shuffle Off To Buffalo&quot;, &quot;Young and Healthy&quot; and the grandiose story of urban life, the finale &quot;42nd Street&quot;. The film was a smash hit, and Warner Brothers knew who made it such an extraordinary success: Berkeley, as well as the composer Harry Warren and the lyricist Al Dubin got seven year contracts. Berkeley created musical numbers for almost every great musical that Warner Brothers produced from 1933 to 1937. His overhead shots forced him to drill holes in the studio roofs, and he used more dancers with each succeeding picture. But with the second declining of the musical picture in 1938, he had nothing to do as a choreographer. He directed two non-musical pictures for Warner Brothers, then he went to MGM, where he choreographed the final number from Broadway Serenade (1939) with Jeanette MacDonald. As a director and choreographer, he worked on four pictures with the teenage stars Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney. He also choreographed the Fascinatin&apos; Rhythm finale for MGM&apos;s reigning tapping star, Eleanor Powell in Lady Be Good (1941). He directed Gene Kelly in his first picture, in For Me and My Gal (1942). Kelly, who choreographed his own numbers, learned a lot from Berkeley. He worked for 20th Century-Fox in The Gang&apos;s All Here (1939) with its surrealistic number &quot;The Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat&quot;. At the end of the 40s he directed his last picture, Take Me Out to the Ball Game (1949), but this time the choreography was direct by Gene Kelly. He did a few numbers in the early 50s, but by the end of the decade, he was all but forgotten. A revival of his films in the late 60s brought him some popularity and he was asked to return to Broadway and supervise the dance direction in the revival a Vincent Youmans musical comedy from 1925. One of the actresses in this production was Ruby Keeler, one of his leading ladies in Warner musicals. When the production went on tour in 1972, one of the road cast was Eleanor Powell. The production was a smash hit. When he walked on stage after on opening night, the house exploded with applause. A strange fact is that Busby Berkeley never had a dancing lesson, and in his early days, he was very afraid of people finding out. He often drove his producers almost crazy when he gave orders to build a set and then sat in front of it for a few days, thinking up the numbers."

The real truth, however, was that she had been placed in a mental institution, where she would remain for years, and he was never told about it (he never saw his mother again until he was in his late 20s). He left school at 14, lying about his age and forging his father&apos;s signature on a letter to join Bob Pender&apos;s troupe of knockabout comedians.

Their show on Broadway, &quot;Good Times,&quot; ran for 456 performances, giving Grant time to acclimatize. He would stay in America. Mae West wanted Grant for She Done Him Wrong (1933) because she saw his combination of virility, sexuality and the aura and bearing of a gentleman. Grant was young enough to begin the new career of fatherhood when he stopped making movies at age 62. One biographer said Grant was alienated by the new realism in the film industry. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he had invented a man-of-the-world persona and a style--&quot;high comedy with polished words.&quot; In To Catch a Thief (1955), he and Grace Kelly were allowed to improvise some of the dialogue. They knew what the director, Alfred Hitchcock, wanted to do with a scene, they rehearsed it, put in some clever double entendres that got past the censors, and then the scene was filmed.

She made her acting debut when she was just six months old, when director James Cruze saw her in her baby carriage and immediately cast her as the baby in his film Mannequin (1926). Her first major role was in Night Nurse (1931), in which she played a sick child that a sinister hospital staff was trying to murder. By age 10, Marcia Mae had appeared in several dramatic films. In 1936, she played a terrified victim of school bullying in These Three (1936), a role that brought her much attention. In 1937, she played the crippled Klara in Heidi (1937). The film starred two other child actors, Delmar Watson (as with Marcia Mae, all of Delmar&apos;s siblings were actors) and Shirley Temple. Despite a four-year age difference, Marcia Mae and Shirley acted well with each other, and they appeared together again in The Little Princess (1939). Besides Shirley Temple and Delmar Watson, Marcia Mae worked with several other child stars of the 1930s, including Jane Withers, Bonita Granville, Jackie Moran, Sybil Jason, and her favorite, Jackie Cooper.

His movies are distinguished by slow pacing, vague, but compelling plots, and often obsessive characters. Hellman was born on July 12, 1932 in New York City. Monte studied drama at Stanford University and film at UCLA. Hellman hooked up with legendary exploitation movie producer Roger Corman in the late 50s. He made his film debut as director with the enjoyable creature feature &quot;The Beast from Haunted Cave.&quot; Monte also directed portions of the notorious Corman fright flick fiasco &quot;The Terror.&quot; Hellman joined forces with frequent collaborator Jack Nicholson for two pictures that were shot back-to-back on shoestring budgets in the Philippines: the exciting World War II potboiler &quot;Back Door to Hell&quot; and the entertaining action thriller &quot;Flight to Fury&quot; (Nicholson also penned the screenplay for this latter film). Monte then reteamed with Nicholson for two outstanding and enigmatic existential Westerns that were filmed in Utah under similar conditions: &quot;Ride in The Whirlwind&quot; -- Nicholson once again also wrote the script -- and the especially striking &quot;The Shooting,&quot; which was the first of four features Hellman did with scruffy character actor supreme Warren Oates. &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot; rates highly as Monte&apos;s most remarkable cinematic achievement to date: it&apos;s a fascinatingly bleak and oblique road movie that perfectly nails the bummed-out malaise of the early 70s, boasts musicians James Taylor and Dennis Wilson in their sole acting efforts, and showcases an amazing central performance by Oates as mysterious motorist &quot;GTO.&quot; &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot; received favorable reviews from most critics, but alas bombed at the box office. Luckily, it has since garnered a well-deserved avid fan following. &quot;Cockfighter&quot; was an excellent adaptation of Charles Willeford&apos;s gritty novel with another mesmerizing lead performance by the incomparable Oates. Hellman began the Hammer crime action yarn &quot;Shatter,&quot; but was replaced by Michael Carreras halfway through the production and directed an episode of &quot;Baretta.&quot; &quot;China 9, Liberty 37&quot; was a typically quirky revisionist spaghetti Western. &quot;Iguana&quot; offered a brutal and provocative allegory on the darkest aspects of human nature, but unfortunately suffered from poor distribution. &quot;Silent Night, Deadly Night 3: Better Watch Out!&quot; qualifies as Hellman&apos;s worst movie; it&apos;s a run-of-the-mill slasher sequel that&apos;s totally unworthy of his considerable talents.

He was the son of a mill worker, and studied for a career in architecture which he indeed began. But with World War I he left his position to join the British army. After the war he set his sights in a different direction, training to become an actor by attending the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. His first stage play was in 1921. He honed his skills thereafter (from 1922 to 1939) principally as a Shakespearian actor at the Old Vic in London or at Stratford-upon-Avon - and later the Open Air in Regent&apos;s Park. But by 1930 he was giving time to films as well. His first movie was the Sean O&apos;Casey play Juno and the Paycock (1930), one of Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s early sound efforts. With his craggy profile and arcing bulbous nose, and rather stern visage (though it could as quickly break into a broad smile), he was right for many a memorable character. Hitchcock made sure of that first off by calling on him again to play the dour, suspicious, and miserly farmer, John Crofter, in The 39 Steps (1935). Laurie became a good friend of another Shakespearean, Laurence Olivier, and the two, Olivier as a lead, were in Hungarian director/producer Paul Czinner&apos;s As You Like It (1936). The year 1937 was a busy one, with six films, the most important giving him one of his few leading roles. This was director/screen writer Michael Powell&apos;s intriguing The Edge of the World (1937), doubly important in that it was the film that sold Powell to producers like Alexander Korda. The film was shot on location on the remote Shetland isle of Foula, the furthest point of Britain. It dealt with the impact of the modern world on the lives of the inhabitants of an economically decaying island. Into 1938 and 1939 Laurie was involved in British experimental TV movies, that medium to be revisit later frequently. In 1939 he was taped by Alexander Korda for his classic film production of The Four Feathers (1939) in which Laurie, who could fit his Scots voice to any part, played the zealous Mahdi (the Khalifa). He is hardly to be recognized in character.&#013;&#010;Through the remainder of the decade and into the 1950s, Laurie&apos;s face showed up in a variety of films - with greater frequency as assorted Scotsmen-comedic an otherwise - and further down the credits list of supporting actors. He was familiar in the decade invasion to the UK of American co-productions, such as Disney&apos;s Treasure Island (1950) and Kidnapped (1960). And he even trod the uncertain path of a few sci-fi films - that shall remain nameless here. But he was certainly always busy - when all told - the actor&apos;s foremost blessing. Television drama and series gave him better opportunities for a veteran actor, beginning with a Henry V (1953) (TV) where he played the comic role of Pistol. Along with some BBC TV theater (more Shakespeare and some American playhouse as well) and sporadic serials, he had a stint on the long-running BBC children&apos;s reading program &quot;Jackanory&quot;. And he is probably best remembered as the dour James Frazer on the popular &quot;Dad&apos;s Army&quot; series (1968-1977). But one of his last and most touching performance was simply being his good-natured self - 80 years old but still a vibrant man with his Scots burr - when he accompanied Powell back to dramatically isolated Foula for the director&apos;s short documentary Return to the Edge of the World (1978) (included with the 2003 DVD release of the 1937 movie). There was a bit of staging by Powell. But Laurie&apos;s animated face was a picture of profound humanity, as - with a shade of theatrics when appropriate - he remembered the shoot and with sincere joy renewed acquaintances with the inhabitants, as if he himself had returned once more to his native heath.

In 1933, her mother brought Ida with her to an audition and Ida got the part her mother wanted. The picture was Her First Affaire (1932). Ida, a bleached blonde, came to Hollywood in 1934 and played small and insignificant parts. Peter Ibbetson (1935) was one of her few noteworthy movies and it was not until The Light That Failed (1939) that she got a chance to get better parts. In most of her movies, she was cast as the hard, but sympathetic woman from the wrong side of the tracks. In The Sea Wolf (1941) and High Sierra (1941), she played the part magnificently. It has been said that no one could do hard-luck dames the way Lupino could do them. She played tough, knowing characters who held their own against some of the biggest leading men of the day - Humphrey Bogart, Ronald Colman, John Garfield and Edward G. Robinson. She made a handful of films during the forties playing different characters ranging from Pillow to Post (1945), where she played a traveling saleswoman to the tough nightclub singer in The Man I Love (1947). But good roles for women were hard to get and there were many young actresses and established stars competing for those roles. She left Warner Brothers in 1947 and became a freelance actress. When better roles did not materialize, Ida stepped behind the camera as a director, writer and producer. Her first directing job came when director Elmer Clifton fell ill on a script that she co-wrote Not Wanted (1949). Ida had joked that as an actress, she was the poor man&apos;s Bette Davis. Now, she said that as a director, she became the poor man&apos;s Don Siegel. The films that she wrote, or directed, or appeared in during the fifties were mostly inexpensive melodramas. She later turned to Television where she directed episodes in shows such as &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1959) and &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1963).

He forsook a thriving career as an architect in his twenties for stage acting, receiving early training at the Alcazar Theatre in San Francisco with Bert Lytell and Bessie Barriscale. He then moved to New York where he earned a number of regional roles in the Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia areas before making his Broadway bow with &quot;The Marriage Game&quot; in 1913. He proceeded to build up his resume impressively with the plays &quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot; in 1914 and when it was revived in 1918, &quot;The Broken Wing (1920), &quot;Craig&apos;s Wife (1925), &quot;Ladies Leave&quot; (1929) and &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; (1933). He made a sampling of silents over the years as well, primarily in drama, with The Fight (1915), Thais (1917/I) and The Eternal Magdalene (1919) to name a few. After co-starring opposite Corinne Griffith in Island Wives (1922), however, he was not seen again for nearly a decade.&#013;&#010;After a steady diet of Broadway plays, he was signed by Paramount for character roles in sound pictures and proceeded to support the top stars. With his rangy build, piercing blue eyes, premature gray hair and serious countenance, Trowbridge was particularly useful throughout the 1930s and 1940s in crime yarns, horrors and in rugged settings starting out with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard in the romantic drama I Take This Woman (1931). Trowbridge usually adopted a friendly but intelligent, officious demeanor as assorted doctors, judges, bankers, lawyers, military brass and even U.S. presidents. He appeared rather indiscriminately in a number of &quot;A&quot; quality films including Captains Courageous (1937), Meet John Doe (1941), Sergeant York (1941) and Mildred Pierce (1945), and in popular cliffhangers such as King of the Texas Rangers (1941), Adventures of the Flying Cadets (1943) and Captain America (1944). He often played well-meaning victims who died in the first reel, notably in horrors. His last two films were unbilled bits, courtesy of John Ford, in The Wings of Eagles (1957) and The Last Hurrah (1958). Retired thereafter, Trowbridge passed away a number of years later at age 85."

He was born Bruno William VeSota on March 25th, 1922 in Chicago, Illinois. He was the second of three sons born to Lithuanian immigrants Kasmir and Eleanora VeSota. Bruno first began acting in the 7th grade while attending the Catholic parochial school St. George&apos;s. He made his stage debut as the villain in the children&apos;s play &quot;Christopher&apos;s Orphans.&quot; At age 19 VeSota went to the Hobart Theatre in Chicago where he learned the basics on acting, make-up and direction. He made his stage directorial debut with a production of &quot;Richard III&quot; and went on to direct everything from the classics to light comedies. After briefly working in Lithuanian radio in the 40s Vesota did a longer stint on English-language radio. He even provided the voice of Winston Churchill for a radio production. Moreover, Bruno joined the Actors Company of Chicago and continued to perform on stage. VeSota then worked in live television in Chicago in 1945. He directed over 2,000 live TV programs and acted in some 200 more. VeSota moved to Hollywood, California in 1952. Bruno began acting in films in 1953. He achieved his greatest cult feature popularity with his frequent and delightful appearances in a bunch of hugely enjoyable low-budget Roger Corman exploitation pictures. Bruno was especially excellent as Yvette Vickers&apos; angry cuckolded husband in the Grade B monster classic &quot;Attack of the Giant Leeches.&quot; Other notable movie roles include a disgusting slob junkyard owner who sells stolen automobile parts on the side in &quot;The Choppers,&quot; a bartender in &quot;The Haunted Palace,&quot; a hapless night watchman who becomes a victim of &quot;The Wasp Woman,&quot; a snobby coffeehouse regular in the hilarious black comedy gem &quot;A Bucket of Blood,&quot; a perverse oddball named Mr. Donald Duck from Duluth in &quot;Single Room Unfurnished,&quot; a nervous innkeeper in &quot;The Undead,&quot; a Russian spy in &quot;War of the Satellites,&quot; a minister in &quot;Hell&apos;s Angels on Wheels,&quot; a cultured gangster in &quot;Daddy-O,&quot; and a brutish loan enforcer in &quot;Carnival Rock.&quot; Bruno narrated the atrocious cheapie clunker &quot;Curse of the Stoned Hand&quot; for notorious schlockmeister Jerry Warren.

He settled in Los Angeles in the mid-1950s, where he was noticed by producer/director Roger Corman, who cast him in most of his low-budget films, usually playing unlikeable sorts, such as a vacuum-cleaner salesman in Not of This Earth (1957). His most memorable role would have to be that of the mentally unstable, busboy/beatnik artist Walter Paisley, whose clay sculptures are suspiciously lifelike in A Bucket of Blood (1959) (a rare starring role for him), and he is also fondly remembered for his supporting role as the flower-eating Vurson Fouch in Corman&apos;s legendary The Little Shop of Horrors (1960). Miller spent the next 20 years working in Corman productions, and starting in the late 1970s was often cast in films by director Joe Dante, appearing in credited and uncredited walk-on bits as quirky chatterboxes, and stole every scene he appeared in. He has played many variations on his famous Walter Paisley role, such as a diner owner (Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983)) or a janitor (Chopping Mall (1986)).

His father had studied singing and young Gene displayed an early interest in drama and music. Shortly after the 7-year-old danced a Highland fling in a concert given by the 48th Highlanders&apos; Regimental Band, his father joined the band as a Scottish tenor. The Lockhart family accompanied the band to England. While his father toured, Gene studied at the Brompton Oratory School in London. When they returned to Canada, Gene began singing in concert, often on the same program with Beatrice Lillie. His mother encouraged his career, urging him to try for a part on Broadway. Lockhart went to America. At 25, he got a part in a New York play in September, 1917, as Gustave in Klaw and Erlanger&apos;s musical &quot;The Riviera Girl.&quot; Between acting engagements, he wrote for the stage. His first production was &quot;The Pierrot Players&quot; for which he wrote both book and lyrics and played. It toured Canada in 1919 and introduced &quot;The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise&quot; (words by Lockhart, music by Ernest Seitz), which became a very popular ballad.. &quot;Heigh-Ho&quot; (1920) followed, a musical fantasy with score by Deems Taylor and book and lyrics by Lockhart. It had a short run (again, with him in the cast). Lockhart&apos;s first real break as a dramatic actor came in the supporting role of Bud, a mountaineer moonshiner, in Lula Vollmer&apos;s Sun Up (1939) (TV). This was an American folk play, first presented by The Players, a theatrical club, in a Greenwich Village little theater in 1923. After great notices it moved to a larger house for a two-year run. During this engagement, in 1924 at the age of 33, Lockhart married Kathleen Lockhart (aka Kathleen Arthur), an English actress and musician. Gene meanwhile also appeared in a series of performances presented by The Players in New York theaters: as Gregoire in &quot;The Little Father of the Wilderness&quot;; as Waitwell in &quot;The Way of the World,&quot; as Gumption Cute in &quot;Uncle Tom&apos;s Cabin&quot;, and as Faust in &quot;Mephisto.&quot; The Lockharts&apos; daughter, June Lockhart, was born in 1925. She would eventually appear regularly in the television series &quot;Lassie&quot; (1954) and &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (1965). In 1933, Gene and Kathleen were featured in &quot;Sunday Night at Nine,&quot; a radio program presented at New York&apos;s Barbizon-Plaza Hotel. Meanwhile, Lockhart was keeping busy writing articles for theatrical magazines and a weekly column for a Canadian publication, coaching members of New York&apos;s Junior League in dramatics, lecturing on dramatic technique at the Julliard School of Music, and directing a revival of &quot;The Warrior&apos;s Husband&quot;--a formidable schedule. It amused him as he said that, &quot;in spite of [the amount of work in a typical day] I don&apos;t get thin.&quot; Lockhart had by this time taken on the appearance that audiences would see again and again in films--short and plump with a chubby, jowly face and twinkling blue eyes. In 1933, he played Uncle Sid in the Theatre Guild&apos;s production of Eugene O&apos;Neill&apos;s comedy &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot; co-starring George M. Cohan. This was the role that was to bring Lockhart stardom and lead to a contract with RKO Pictures and his first film, By Your Leave (1934). O&apos;Neill wrote to Lockhart: &quot;Every time your Sid has come in for dinner I&apos;ve wanted to burst into song, and every time you&apos;ve come down from that nap I&apos;ve felt the cold gray ghost of an old heebie-jeebie.&quot; The acclaim for his acting in &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot; allowed Lockhart to proceed to Hollywood and remain there almost without interruption. However, he was back on Broadway in December, 1949, when he took over the part of Willy Loman in the New York production of &quot;Death of a Salesman.&quot; Lockhart appeared in over 125 films. Though he often played upright doctors, judges and businessmen, and was in real life described as an amiable and gentle soul, Lockhart is perhaps best remembered on film as a villain who usually ends up cowering in a corner whimpering pitifully before getting his just desserts, a scene he played to the hilt in such movies as Algiers (1938) (for which he was nominated for an Oscar), Blackmail (1939), Geronimo (1939), Northern Pursuit (1943), and Hangmen Also Die! (1943). Late on Saturday, March 30, 1957, Lockhart suffered a heart attack while sleeping in his apartment at 10439 Ashton Avenue in West Los Angeles. He was taken to St. John&apos;s Hospital and died on Sunday afternoon, March 31. He is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery."

Lovecraft-inspired Die, Monster, Die! (1965). Karloff&apos;s last great role was as an aging horror movie star confronting a modern-day sniper in the Peter Bogdanovich film Targets (1968). His TV career was capped off by achieving Christmas immortality as the narrator of Chuck Jones&apos;s perennial animated favorite, How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1966) (TV). Three low-budget Mexican-produced horror films starring an ailing Karloff were released in the two years after his death; however, they do no justice to this great actor. In retrospect, he never took himself too seriously as an actor and had a tendency to downplay his acting accomplishments.

His father and uncle were first-generation acting Tearles, and his mother also came from a family of actors. It seems that Godfrey&apos;s destiny was set at birth. The Tearles&apos; family&apos;s origins lay rooted in the rural areas of Bedfordshire. His grandfather was a soldier who served in the Crimean War. Godfrey made his stage debut at age nine as young Prince Richard, Duke of York, in his father&apos;s production of &quot;Richard III.&quot; He subsequently attended Carlisle Grammar School in Carlisle, England, but continued acting in his father&apos;s company into his teen years. His older half-brother, Frederick (Levy), was also a successful actor and later billed himself as Conway Tearle and earned distinction as a suave silent-era matinee idol. In 1908 Godfrey made his film debut in a shortened version of Romeo and Juliet (1908/I), at the Lyceum Theatre, which co-starred then-wife actress Mary Malone. Building up his stage reputation in the classics, he became a Shakespearean player of note with sterling portrayals of &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Henry V&quot;, among others. Active service in the Royal Field Artillery in 1915 temporarily interrupted his budding theater career for nearly four years. He returned to the footlights, but also attempted to earn a reputation in silents. Although he was less successful, Godfrey&apos;s mellifluous voice proved ideal for sound and he made a mild go of it with occasional movie forays in the 1930s and 1940s. He distinguished himself as patrician gents in both character leads and supports. He made a particular impression in The 39 Steps (1935), Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s classic thriller, in which he played the professor (aka menacing agent) minus a finger; The Beginning or the End (1947) as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt; Mandy (1952), a four-tissue tearjerker, as the grandfather of a deaf child; and the charming comedy The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953) as a genial bishop, which was released the year of his death. On the personal front, he and actress Malone were divorced after 20 years of marriage, and Godfrey married much-younger starlet Stella Freeman in 1932. Tragically she died aged 26 in May 1936 from pneumonia, just a few months after the suicide of his actor/brother Malcolm Tearle. A third marriage failed for but he managed to enjoy the last few years of his life in the company of Stratford stage actress Jill Bennett. He was knighted in 1951 and died two years later in London, following a lengthy illness, at age 68."

The younger Chaney was born while his parents were on a theatrical tour, and he joined them onstage for the first time at the age of six months. However, as a young man, even during the time of his father&apos;s growing fame, Creighton Chaney worked menial jobs to support himself without calling upon his father. He was at various times a plumber, a meatcutter&apos;s apprentice, a metal worker, and a farm worker. Always, however, there was the desire to follow in his father&apos;s footsteps. He studied makeup at his father&apos;s side, learning many of the techniques that had made his father famous. And he took stage roles in stock companies. It was not until after his father&apos;s death in 1930 that Chaney went to work in films. His first appearances were under his real name (he had been named for his mother, singer Cleva Creighton). He played number of supporting parts before a producer in 1935 insisted on changing his name to Lon Chaney Jr. as a marketing ploy. Chaney was uncomfortable with the ploy and always hated the &quot;Jr&quot;. addendum. But he was also aware that the famous name could help his career, and so he kept it. Most of the parts he played were unmemorable, often bits, until 1939 when he was given the role of the simple-minded Lennie in the film adaptation of John Steinbeck&apos;s Of Mice and Men (1939). Chaney&apos;s performance was spectacularly touching; indeed, it became one of the two roles for which he would always be best remembered. The other came within the next year, when Universal, in hopes of reviving their horror film franchise as well as memories of their great silent star, Chaney Sr., cast Chaney as the tortured Lawrence Talbot in The Wolf Man (1941). With this film and the slew of horror films that followed it, Chaney achieved a kind of stardom, though he was never able to achieve his goal of surpassing his father. By the 1950s, he was established as a star in low-budget horror films and as a reliable character actor in more prestigious, big-budget films such as High Noon (1952). Never as versatile as his father, he fell more and more into cheap and mundane productions which traded primarily on his name and those of other fading horror stars. His later years were bedeviled by illness and problems with alcohol. When he died from a variety of causes in 1973, it was as an actor who had spent his life chasing the fame of his father, but who was much beloved by a generation of filmgoers who had never seen his father."

He started direct involvement in films in 1953 as a producer and screenwriter, making his debut as director in 1955. Between then and his official retirement in 1971 he directed dozens of films, often as many as six or seven per year, typically shot extremely quickly on leftover sets from other, larger, productions. His probably unbeatable record for a professional 35mm feature film was two days and a night to shoot the original version of The Little Shop of Horrors (1960), though several other films were made in less than a week. In the early 1960s, his budgets got bigger (though never big), when he made a series of adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe stories starring Vincent Price. Apart from Frankenstein Unbound (1990), he retired from directing in 1971 to concentrate on production and distribution through his company New World (and later Concorde), making low-budget exploitation films and using the profits to distribute distinguished art films. Apart from making dozens of enormously entertaining films (there are amazingly few duds in his output), Corman&apos;s place in film history is assured simply through his unrivalled eye for talent - among many world-class names who were employed by him at a very early stage in their careers are Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme, James Cameron, Peter Bogdanovich, Joe Dante and many others - which means that his influence on modern American cinema is almost incalculable."

In Mexico her company&apos;s performance even created a cease-fire between revolutionary leader Pancho Villa&apos;s forces and federal troops during the Mexican revolution, so all could enjoy her performance. While in New York, writer Henry Miller saw her perform and included a multi-page glowing critique of her work in one of his major novels, &quot;Plexus, the Rosy Cruisfixion&quot;. In 1945 Mimi became a naturalized American citizen and expanded her work to include motion pictures in the US, Italy and Mexico. She had three children, one of whom, Argentina Brunetti, became a leading American motion picture character actress and journalist. Mimi continued to work as a character actress into her 80s.

The immigrant who had struggled and been humiliated but persevere due to his inner resolution harnessed the mytho-poetic power of the movie to create proletarian passion plays that appealed to the psyche of the New Deal movie-goer. The country during the Depression was down but not out, and the ultimate success of the individual in the Capra films was a bracing tonic for the movie audience of the 1930s. His own personal history, transformed on the screen, became their myths that got them through the Depression, and when that and the war was over, the great filmmaker found himself out of time. Capra, like Charles Dickens, moralized political and economic issues. Both were primarily masters of personal and moral expression, and not of the social and political. It was the emotional realism, not the social realism, of such films as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), which he was concerned with, and by focusing on the emotional and moral issues his protagonists faced, typically dramatized as a conflict between cynicism and the protagonist&apos;s faith and idealism, that made the movies so powerful, and made them register so powerfully with an audience."

His movies are distinguished by slow pacing, vague, but compelling plots, and often obsessive characters. Hellman was born on July 12, 1932 in New York City. Monte studied drama at Stanford University and film at UCLA. Hellman hooked up with legendary exploitation movie producer Roger Corman in the late 50s. He made his film debut as director with the enjoyable creature feature &quot;The Beast from Haunted Cave.&quot; Monte also directed portions of the notorious Corman fright flick fiasco &quot;The Terror.&quot; Hellman joined forces with frequent collaborator Jack Nicholson for two pictures that were shot back-to-back on shoestring budgets in the Philippines: the exciting World War II potboiler &quot;Back Door to Hell&quot; and the entertaining action thriller &quot;Flight to Fury&quot; (Nicholson also penned the screenplay for this latter film). Monte then reteamed with Nicholson for two outstanding and enigmatic existential Westerns that were filmed in Utah under similar conditions: &quot;Ride in The Whirlwind&quot; -- Nicholson once again also wrote the script -- and the especially striking &quot;The Shooting,&quot; which was the first of four features Hellman did with scruffy character actor supreme Warren Oates. &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot; rates highly as Monte&apos;s most remarkable cinematic achievement to date: it&apos;s a fascinatingly bleak and oblique road movie that perfectly nails the bummed-out malaise of the early 70s, boasts musicians James Taylor and Dennis Wilson in their sole acting efforts, and showcases an amazing central performance by Oates as mysterious motorist &quot;GTO.&quot; &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot; received favorable reviews from most critics, but alas bombed at the box office. Luckily, it has since garnered a well-deserved avid fan following. &quot;Cockfighter&quot; was an excellent adaptation of Charles Willeford&apos;s gritty novel with another mesmerizing lead performance by the incomparable Oates. Hellman began the Hammer crime action yarn &quot;Shatter,&quot; but was replaced by Michael Carreras halfway through the production and directed an episode of &quot;Baretta.&quot; &quot;China 9, Liberty 37&quot; was a typically quirky revisionist spaghetti Western. &quot;Iguana&quot; offered a brutal and provocative allegory on the darkest aspects of human nature, but unfortunately suffered from poor distribution. &quot;Silent Night, Deadly Night 3: Better Watch Out!&quot; qualifies as Hellman&apos;s worst movie; it&apos;s a run-of-the-mill slasher sequel that&apos;s totally unworthy of his considerable talents.

He was born Bruno William VeSota on March 25th, 1922 in Chicago, Illinois. He was the second of three sons born to Lithuanian immigrants Kasmir and Eleanora VeSota. Bruno first began acting in the 7th grade while attending the Catholic parochial school St. George&apos;s. He made his stage debut as the villain in the children&apos;s play &quot;Christopher&apos;s Orphans.&quot; At age 19 VeSota went to the Hobart Theatre in Chicago where he learned the basics on acting, make-up and direction. He made his stage directorial debut with a production of &quot;Richard III&quot; and went on to direct everything from the classics to light comedies. After briefly working in Lithuanian radio in the 40s Vesota did a longer stint on English-language radio. He even provided the voice of Winston Churchill for a radio production. Moreover, Bruno joined the Actors Company of Chicago and continued to perform on stage. VeSota then worked in live television in Chicago in 1945. He directed over 2,000 live TV programs and acted in some 200 more. VeSota moved to Hollywood, California in 1952. Bruno began acting in films in 1953. He achieved his greatest cult feature popularity with his frequent and delightful appearances in a bunch of hugely enjoyable low-budget Roger Corman exploitation pictures. Bruno was especially excellent as Yvette Vickers&apos; angry cuckolded husband in the Grade B monster classic &quot;Attack of the Giant Leeches.&quot; Other notable movie roles include a disgusting slob junkyard owner who sells stolen automobile parts on the side in &quot;The Choppers,&quot; a bartender in &quot;The Haunted Palace,&quot; a hapless night watchman who becomes a victim of &quot;The Wasp Woman,&quot; a snobby coffeehouse regular in the hilarious black comedy gem &quot;A Bucket of Blood,&quot; a perverse oddball named Mr. Donald Duck from Duluth in &quot;Single Room Unfurnished,&quot; a nervous innkeeper in &quot;The Undead,&quot; a Russian spy in &quot;War of the Satellites,&quot; a minister in &quot;Hell&apos;s Angels on Wheels,&quot; a cultured gangster in &quot;Daddy-O,&quot; and a brutish loan enforcer in &quot;Carnival Rock.&quot; Bruno narrated the atrocious cheapie clunker &quot;Curse of the Stoned Hand&quot; for notorious schlockmeister Jerry Warren.

With great names such as Johnnie the Shiek, Boots Burnett, Ice Box Hamilton, Wires Kagel, Ropes McGonigle, Society Max, and Toothpick Charlie, Stone delighted audiences in scores of crimers for decades. A vaudeville and Broadway hoofer in the interim, the runt-sized Stone (5&apos; 3&quot;) finally scored in his first &quot;grownup&quot; part as the Sewer Rat in the silent drama 7th Heaven (1927) starring the once-popular romantic pair Charles Farrell and (Academy Award winner) Janet Gaynor. As &quot;Georgie&quot; sounded too child-like, he began billing himself as &quot;George E. Stone.&quot; From there he was featured in a number of &quot;tough guy&quot; potboilers, particularly for Warner Bros. So typed was he as a henchman or thug, that he found few films outside the genre. His gunsels often possessed a yellow streak and could be both broadly comic or threatening in nature, with more than a few of them ending up on a morgue slab before film&apos;s end, including his Earl Williams on The Front Page (1931) and Otero in the classic gangster flick Little Caesar (1931). Stone&apos;s most popular role of the 1940s was as The Runt in the Boston Blackie film series which ran from 1941 to 1948 and starred Chester Morris.

Her parents were both successful stage actors, especially her father, Richard Bennett, and often toured the country for weeks at a time. In fact, Joan came from a long line of actors, dating back to the 18th century. Often, when her parents were on tour, Joan and her two older sisters, Constance Bennett, who later became an actress, and Barbara were left in the care of close friends. At the age of four, Joan made her first stage appearance. She debuted in films a year later in The Valley of Decision (1916), in which her father was the star and the entire Bennett clan participated. In 1923 she again appeared in a film which starred her father, playing a pageboy in The Eternal City (1923). It would be five more years before Joan appeared again on the screen. In between, she married Jack Marion Fox, who was 26 compared to her young age of 16. The union was anything but happy, in great part because of Fox&apos;s heavy drinking. In February of 1928 Joan and Jack had a baby girl they named Adrienne. The new arrival did little to help the marriage, though, and in the summer of 1928 they divorced. Now with a baby to support, Joan did something she had no intention of doing--she turned to acting. She appeared in Power (1928) with Alan Hale and Carole Lombard, a small role but a start. The next year she starred in Bulldog Drummond (1929), sharing top billing with Ronald Colman. Before the year was out she was in three more films--Disraeli (1929), The Mississippi Gambler (1929) and Three Live Ghosts (1929). Not only did audiences like her, but so did the critics. Between 1930 and 1931, Joan appeared in nine more movies. In 1932 she starred opposite Spencer Tracy in She Wanted a Millionaire (1932), but it wasn&apos;t one she liked to remember, partly because Tracy couldn&apos;t stand the fact that everyone was paying more attention to her than to him. Joan was to remain busy and popular throughout the rest of the 1930s and into the 1940s. By the 1950s Joan was well into her 40s and began to lessen her film appearances. She made only eight pictures, in addition to appearing in two television series. After Desire in the Dust (1960), Joan would be absent from the movie scene for the next ten years, resurfacing in House of Dark Shadows (1970), reprising her role from the &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; (1966) TV series as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard. Joan&apos;s final screen appearance was in the Italian thriller Suspiria (1977). Her final public performance was in the TV movie Divorce Wars: A Love Story (1982) (TV).

The younger Chaney was born while his parents were on a theatrical tour, and he joined them onstage for the first time at the age of six months. However, as a young man, even during the time of his father&apos;s growing fame, Creighton Chaney worked menial jobs to support himself without calling upon his father. He was at various times a plumber, a meatcutter&apos;s apprentice, a metal worker, and a farm worker. Always, however, there was the desire to follow in his father&apos;s footsteps. He studied makeup at his father&apos;s side, learning many of the techniques that had made his father famous. And he took stage roles in stock companies. It was not until after his father&apos;s death in 1930 that Chaney went to work in films. His first appearances were under his real name (he had been named for his mother, singer Cleva Creighton). He played number of supporting parts before a producer in 1935 insisted on changing his name to Lon Chaney Jr. as a marketing ploy. Chaney was uncomfortable with the ploy and always hated the &quot;Jr&quot;. addendum. But he was also aware that the famous name could help his career, and so he kept it. Most of the parts he played were unmemorable, often bits, until 1939 when he was given the role of the simple-minded Lennie in the film adaptation of John Steinbeck&apos;s Of Mice and Men (1939). Chaney&apos;s performance was spectacularly touching; indeed, it became one of the two roles for which he would always be best remembered. The other came within the next year, when Universal, in hopes of reviving their horror film franchise as well as memories of their great silent star, Chaney Sr., cast Chaney as the tortured Lawrence Talbot in The Wolf Man (1941). With this film and the slew of horror films that followed it, Chaney achieved a kind of stardom, though he was never able to achieve his goal of surpassing his father. By the 1950s, he was established as a star in low-budget horror films and as a reliable character actor in more prestigious, big-budget films such as High Noon (1952). Never as versatile as his father, he fell more and more into cheap and mundane productions which traded primarily on his name and those of other fading horror stars. His later years were bedeviled by illness and problems with alcohol. When he died from a variety of causes in 1973, it was as an actor who had spent his life chasing the fame of his father, but who was much beloved by a generation of filmgoers who had never seen his father."

In the course of the following decade, he also performed in an American vaudeville tour with his young wife, Frances, in a routine called &quot;The Suffragette.&quot; As World War I grew in scale, Zucco returned to England to join the army. He saw action and was wounded in his right arm by gunfire. Subsequent surgery partially handicapped the use of two fingers and a thumb. However, having honed his theatrical talents, he proceeded to enter the London stage scene and was rewarded with a developing career that made him a leading man as the 1920s progressed. By 1931 he began working in British sound films, his first being Dreyfus (1931) with Cedric Hardwicke. What followed were 13 B-grade movies through 1935, until The Man Who Could Work Miracles (1936) with Roland Young and Ralph Richardson. Zucco was on his way to America and Broadway by late 1935. He had signed to play Disraeli opposite Helen Hayes in the original play &quot;Victoria Regina,&quot; which ran from December 1935 to June 1936. After that came a Hollywood contract and his first American picture, Sinner Take All (1936). Zucco had a sharp hawk nose, magnetic dark eyes, and an arching brow that fit well with authoritative and intimidating characters. That same year, he was in the second installment of the &quot;Thin Man&quot; series, followed by a series of supporting roles in nine films in 1937, usually typed as an English doctor or lord character. They were good supporting roles in &quot;A&quot; films, but he was also taking on darker characters. This was evident in Charlie Chan in Honolulu (1938) and more so with Arrest Bulldog Drummond (1939). Here, he was Rolf Alferson, alias the criminal mastermind &quot;The Stinger,&quot; who could administer a poisonous sting from a needle at the tip of his cane. It was a typical pop movie in the pulp mystery/horror genre with the usual sort of ending, but it started him on the road as a Hollywood arch villain. That same year, he was cast as Professor Moriarty, the brilliant archenemy of the world&apos;s most famous detective in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1939). Also that year, he and Hardwicke reunited to play the dark clerical heavies in the classic The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939). Although into the early 1940s Zucco was still getting some variety in shady roles, he was increasingly accepting parts as mad doctors--ancient and otherwise--starting with The Mummy&apos;s Hand (1940), the sequel to the original The Mummy (1932). Although this was made by the relatively major Universal Pictures, Zucco began grinding out outlandish horror stuff for bottom-of-the-barrel Producers Releasing Corp. (PRC). It would be incorrect to say he sold out to the horror genre, though, even if horror buffs have made him their own. Into the later 1940s, he was still giving good accounts as nobles, judges and not-so-mad doctors in such &quot;A&quot; hits as Captain from Castile (1947), Joan of Arc (1948), and Madame Bovary (1949). Zucco was in real life an engaging personality and was also known as a very dependable actor. He suffered a stroke not long after his final film, David and Bathsheba (1951), once more in Egyptian garb but this time not even credited. He retired and lived on in fragile health. He evidently recovered his health enough to be offered the role of the mad scientist in Voodoo Woman (1957), but he declined. About that time, his health required a move to a nursing home, where he lived out his last years with dignity."

He started direct involvement in films in 1953 as a producer and screenwriter, making his debut as director in 1955. Between then and his official retirement in 1971 he directed dozens of films, often as many as six or seven per year, typically shot extremely quickly on leftover sets from other, larger, productions. His probably unbeatable record for a professional 35mm feature film was two days and a night to shoot the original version of The Little Shop of Horrors (1960), though several other films were made in less than a week. In the early 1960s, his budgets got bigger (though never big), when he made a series of adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe stories starring Vincent Price. Apart from Frankenstein Unbound (1990), he retired from directing in 1971 to concentrate on production and distribution through his company New World (and later Concorde), making low-budget exploitation films and using the profits to distribute distinguished art films. Apart from making dozens of enormously entertaining films (there are amazingly few duds in his output), Corman&apos;s place in film history is assured simply through his unrivalled eye for talent - among many world-class names who were employed by him at a very early stage in their careers are Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme, James Cameron, Peter Bogdanovich, Joe Dante and many others - which means that his influence on modern American cinema is almost incalculable."

His movie career consisted of playing characters who were charming, good-looking--and bland. In fact, his screen image was such that he usually never got the girl. Louis B. Mayer would say, &quot;He has no sex appeal,&quot; but he had a work ethic that prepared him for every role that he played. And he did play in as many as eleven films per year for a decade starting with The Black Camel (1931). He was notable as the spy in Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s Secret Agent (1936), but the &apos;40s was the decade in which he was to have most of his best roles. These included &apos;Northwest Passage&apos; (Book I -- Rogers&apos; Rangers) (1940); Western Union (1941); and H.M. Pulham, Esq. (1941). Good roles followed, from the husband of Dorothy McGuirein Claudia (1943) to the detective in Crossfire (1947), but they were becoming scarce. In 1949, Robert started a radio show called &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; wherein he played Jim Anderson, an average father with average situations--a role which was tailor-made for him. Basically retiring from films, he starred in this program for five years on radio before it went to television in 1954. After a slight falter in the ratings and a switch from CBS to NBC, it became a mainstay of television until it was canceled in 1960. He continued making guest appearances on various television shows and working in television movies. In 1969, he starred as Dr. Marcus Welby in the TV movie Marcus Welby, M.D. (1969) (TV).

She returned in the mid-30s, as a teenager this time, and began the typical assembly-line route of extra and bit roles for various mega studios, this time billed as Marjorie Moore. Her first speaking role was in Columbia Studio&apos;s programmer Murder in Greenwich Village (1937), this time billed as Marjorie Reynolds (her first husband&apos;s last name), a moniker she kept for the duration of her career. The blonde (originally brunette) actress then went through a rather unchallenging prairie flower phase opposite Hollywood&apos;s top western stars such as Tex Ritter, Buck Jones, Roy Rogers and Tim Holt. It all paid off, however, when she won the top female role opposite Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire in the seasonal film classic Holiday Inn (1942), a role originally designed for Mary Martin. It remains Marjorie&apos;s most popular and cherished role on film, but it did not help her make a permanent transition into &apos;A&apos; quality fare. She continued as a dependable &quot;B&quot; co-lead in such films as Up in Mabel&apos;s Room (1944), Meet Me on Broadway (1946), and Heaven Only Knows (1947), with an exciting movie offer such as Fritz Lang&apos;s Ministry of Fear (1944) coming her way on a rare occasion. Along with maturity and a new entertainment medium (television) in the 50s came a return to her natural hair color. As William Bendix&apos;s patient, resourceful brunette wife on the comedy TV series &quot;The Life of Riley&quot; (1953), Marjorie became a semi-household name. Her career took a steep decline following its demise five years later and she was only sporadically seen in films, commercials and TV guest spots after that. Married twice, her first husband was Jack Reynolds, who was an Assistant Casting Director for Samuel Goldwyn. They had one daughter, Linda, before divorcing in 1952 after 16 years. Second husband, film editor John Whitney, worked for a time in the 40s as an actor. They were married for 32 years until his death in 1985. Long retired, Marjorie died in 1997 of congestive heart failure after collapsing while walking her dog.

The real truth, however, was that she had been placed in a mental institution, where she would remain for years, and he was never told about it (he never saw his mother again until he was in his late 20s). He left school at 14, lying about his age and forging his father&apos;s signature on a letter to join Bob Pender&apos;s troupe of knockabout comedians.

Their show on Broadway, &quot;Good Times,&quot; ran for 456 performances, giving Grant time to acclimatize. He would stay in America. Mae West wanted Grant for She Done Him Wrong (1933) because she saw his combination of virility, sexuality and the aura and bearing of a gentleman. Grant was young enough to begin the new career of fatherhood when he stopped making movies at age 62. One biographer said Grant was alienated by the new realism in the film industry. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he had invented a man-of-the-world persona and a style--&quot;high comedy with polished words.&quot; In To Catch a Thief (1955), he and Grace Kelly were allowed to improvise some of the dialogue. They knew what the director, Alfred Hitchcock, wanted to do with a scene, they rehearsed it, put in some clever double entendres that got past the censors, and then the scene was filmed.

Born to devoutly religious Bostonian parents who had long encouraged her to become a nun, she had been enrolled in a preparatory school for just that purpose. As a young teenager, she worked part time as a photographer&apos;s model, and by her mid-teens she had become more interested in a life in Hollywood than in a convent and had joined a Boston theater company. By this time, her mother had remarried and her new stepfather, a Technicolor expert, had been hired by Tiffany Studios, a bottom-rung Poverty Row studio. The family journeyed to California, and Anne&apos;s first film experience was in several Technicolor experimental shorts directed by her stepfather. She soon graduated to features as a dancer. Her striking beauty and pleasant voice made her a natural for talkies. She landed a contract at Warner Brothers and made her film debut in 1932, enjoying a string of steady, if unspectacular, roles in lower- and medium-budget pictures. Life began to unravel for Nagel in 1936 when she married actor Ross Alexander, a self-hating homosexual prone to drinking and manic depression with an unrequited obsession with Bette Davis. Alexander committed suicide in 1937, and it affected Nagel deeply. Universal, with whom she was under contract by 1941, placed her in several serials and featured her in several of its lower-rank horror pictures and B westerns. She soon left Universal and struck out on her own, but unfortunately she was able to land roles only at Poverty Row studios such as Republic, Monogram, and the nadir of the film industry, PRC. Ironically, her last film, Armored Car Robbery (1950), a taut, highly regarded little thriller now considered a classic of the genre, was easily the best picture she had done in years, and a good one to go out on. She had married an Army Air Corps officer, James H. Keehan, in 1941, but the marriage was increasingly unhappy and they divorced in 1951. Stories spread about her having an alcohol problem, and she spent the last years of her life virtually penniless. Sadly, she died from cancer on July 6, 1966, at only 53 years of age."

However, the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent economic depression forced him to start over.

Like most Asian actors in non-Asian countries, he played primarily small, stereotypical roles, though he rose quickly to familiarity, if not fame, in a number of fine films. His features led him to be a favorite movie villain, and the coming of World War II gave him greater prominence in roles as vicious Japanese soldiers in successful pictures such as The Purple Heart (1944) and God Is My Co-Pilot (1945).

Gretchen was appearing on screen as a child extra by the time she was four, joining her elder sisters, Polly Ann Young and Elizabeth Jane Young (later better known as Sally Blane), as child players. Gretchen then left the screen to attend convent school, but returned at age 14 with a bit appearance in the Colleen Moore vehicle Naughty But Nice (1927). Changing her name to Loretta Young, letting her blond hair revert to its natural brown and with her blue eyes, satin complexion and exquisite face, she quickly graduated from bit player to ingenue to leading lady. She made headlines in 1930 when she and Grant Withers, who was previously married and nine years her senior, eloped to Yuma, Arizona, with the 17-year-old Loretta. They had both appeared in Warner Bros.&apos; The Second Floor Mystery (1930).

The epitome of knavish, continental charm and sartorial opulence, Menjou, complete with trademark waxy black mustache, evolved into one of Hollywood&apos;s most distinguished of artists and fashion plates -- a tailor-made scene-stealer, if you will. What is often forgotten is that he was primed as a matinee idol back in the silent-film days.

Between then and his official retirement in 1971 he directed dozens of films, often as many as six or seven per year, typically shot extremely quickly on leftover sets from other, larger, productions. His probably unbeatable record for a professional 35mm feature film was two days and a night to shoot the original version of The Little Shop of Horrors (1960), though several other films were made in less than a week. In the early 1960s, his budgets got bigger (though never big), when he made a series of adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe stories starring Vincent Price. Apart from Frankenstein Unbound (1990), he retired from directing in 1971 to concentrate on production and distribution through his company New World (and later Concorde), making low-budget exploitation films and using the profits to distribute distinguished art films.

Stone&apos;s most popular role of the 1940s was as The Runt in the Boston Blackie film series which ran from 1941 to 1948 and starred Chester Morris.

He started direct involvement in films in 1953 as a producer and screenwriter, making his debut as director in 1955. Between then and his official retirement in 1971 he directed dozens of films, often as many as six or seven per year, typically shot extremely quickly on leftover sets from other, larger, productions. His probably unbeatable record for a professional 35mm feature film was two days and a night to shoot the original version of The Little Shop of Horrors (1960), though several other films were made in less than a week. In the early 1960s, his budgets got bigger (though never big), when he made a series of adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe stories starring Vincent Price. Apart from Frankenstein Unbound (1990), he retired from directing in 1971 to concentrate on production and distribution through his company New World (and later Concorde), making low-budget exploitation films and using the profits to distribute distinguished art films. Apart from making dozens of enormously entertaining films (there are amazingly few duds in his output), Corman&apos;s place in film history is assured simply through his unrivalled eye for talent - among many world-class names who were employed by him at a very early stage in their careers are Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme, James Cameron, Peter Bogdanovich, Joe Dante and many others - which means that his influence on modern American cinema is almost incalculable."

Groomed in obscure starlet bits, it wasn&apos;t until Warner Bros. signed her up in 1947 and perpetuated an appealing girl-next-door image that things started happening for her. Born the eldest of three daughters to a postal clerk on August 6, 1925, Barbara initially trained in ballet and modeled clothes as a teen. Fighting off a life-long paralyzing shyness, she nevertheless managed to be persuaded to enter a local Denver beauty contest with the winner receiving two round-trip train tickets to Tinseltown. Not only did she win but meeting husband-to-be Cecil Coan, a United Artist publicist, during that trip altered the course of Barbara&apos;s life forever. Settling in Hollywood, it took some time before she started making decent strides as a bobbysoxer ingenue. During her peak she appeared opposite a number of impressive leading men and ladies including Bette Davis in June Bride (1948), Danny Kaye in The Inspector General (1949), Elizabeth Taylor in Rhapsody (1954), and even Dean Martin &amp; Jerry Lewis in their laugh-inducing vehicle The Caddy (1953), to name a few. Interestingly, the one role Barbara will always be identified with is also one of the smallest parts given her during her brief tenure as leading lady. In the very last scene of All About Eve (1950), she turns up in the role of Phoebe, a devious school girl/wannabe actress who shows startling promise as a future schemer, goaded on by the equally ruthless star she idolizes, Eve Harrington, played by Anne Baxter. Barbara&apos;s image is enshrined in the picture&apos;s last scene -- posing in front of a three-way mirror while holding Baxter&apos;s just-received acting award. It is this brief, breathtaking moment for which she will always be remembered.&#013;&#010;Barbara&apos;s on-and-off stage life started unraveling not long after. She became a victim of extreme mood shifts, insecurity, ill health and chronic depression to the point of being taken off two important movies during filming. By 1954, she was washed up in Hollywood. She tried to salvage her career in England and was picked up by the Rank Organization for a time but her films were mediocre and she proved too emotionally unreliable to continue. She finally abandoned her career altogether in 1957 and was not heard of until her death. It was learned that she had retreated to Denver and worked in various minor job capacities including stints as a secretary, dental assistant and hospital aide. Her much older husband and chief supporter, Cecil Coan, died of cancer in January of 1967, and Barbara fell apart. Although she remarried in December of 1968 to a childhood friend, sportscaster William Reed, she remained increasingly despondent and committed suicide just four months later in her mother&apos;s garage by carbon monoxide poisoning. Another sad, tragic ending to a promising Hollywood beauty who seemed destined to have it all."

One could say that Billie was bred for show business. Her family ultimately settled in London, where she was fortunate to see plays in the city&apos;s historic West End, and decided she wanted to be a stage actress.

Billie came to New York when she was 22 and her momentum didn&apos;t stop. She appeared in numerous plays and it was only a matter of time before Hollywood came calling, which is exactly what happened. She made her film debut in the lead role in Peggy (1916).

Their stock investments were wiped out in the crash, which precipitated the Great Depression, and Billie had no choice but to return to the screen. Movies had become even bigger than ten years earlier, especially since the introduction of sound. Her first role of substance was as Margaret Fairlfield in A Bill of Divorcement (1932). As an artist she loved the fact that she had dialog, but she had to work even harder because her husband had died the same year as her speaking debut - and work she did. One of her career highlights came as Mrs. Millicent Jordan in David O.

In 1926 the Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers selected 13 young starlets it deemed most likely to succeed in pictures. Fay was chosen as one of these starlets, along with Janet Gaynor and Mary Astor. Fame would indeed come to Fay when she played another heroine in Erich von Stroheim&apos;s The Wedding March (1928). She continued playing leads in a number of films, such as the good-bad girl in Thunderbolt (1929). By the early 1930s she was at Paramount working with Gary Cooper and Jack Holt in a number of average films, such as Master of Men (1933). She also appeared in such horror films as Doctor X (1932) and The Vampire Bat (1933). In 1933 Fay was approached by producer Merian C. Cooper, who told her that he had a part for her in a picture in which she would be working with a tall, dark leading man. What he didn&apos;t tell her was that her &quot;tall, dark leading man&quot; was a giant gorilla, and the picture turned out to be the classic King Kong (1933). Perhaps no one in the history of pictures could scream more dramatically than Fay, and she really put on a show in &quot;Kong&quot;. Her character provided a combination of sex appeal, vulnerability and lung capacity as she was stalked by the giant beast all the way to the top of the Empire State Building.

Stone (ne George Stein) was in actuality a close friend of writer Damon Runyon and would play a host of colorful &quot;dees, dem and dos&quot; cronies throughout the 1920s, &apos;30s, and &apos;40s. With great names such as Johnnie the Shiek, Boots Burnett, Ice Box Hamilton, Wires Kagel, Ropes McGonigle, Society Max, and Toothpick Charlie, Stone delighted audiences in scores of crimers for decades. A vaudeville and Broadway hoofer in the interim, the runt-sized Stone (5&apos; 3&quot;) finally scored in his first &quot;grownup&quot; part as the Sewer Rat in the silent drama 7th Heaven (1927) starring the once-popular romantic pair Charles Farrell and (Academy Award winner) Janet Gaynor. As &quot;Georgie&quot; sounded too child-like, he began billing himself as &quot;George E. Stone.&quot; From there he was featured in a number of &quot;tough guy&quot; potboilers, particularly for Warner Bros. So typed was he as a henchman or thug, that he found few films outside the genre. His gunsels often possessed a yellow streak and could be both broadly comic or threatening in nature, with more than a few of them ending up on a morgue slab before film&apos;s end, including his Earl Williams on The Front Page (1931) and Otero in the classic gangster flick Little Caesar (1931). Stone&apos;s most popular role of the 1940s was as The Runt in the Boston Blackie film series which ran from 1941 to 1948 and starred Chester Morris. Suffering from failing eyesight in later years, he was virtually blind by the late 1950s but, thanks to friends, managed to secure sporadic film and TV work. From 1958 on, Stone could be glimpsed in a recurring role on the popular courtroom series &quot;Perry Mason&quot; (1957) as a court clerk. Married to second wife Marjorie Ramey in 1946, he died following a stroke in 1967 in Woodland Hills, California, and was survived by two sisters."

He won an oratory contest and was given a scholarship to Northwestern University. His interest in acting was piqued there, and he began appearing in tent shows on the Lyceum-Chautauqua circuit, and in stock. He went to New York in 1929 and got his big break as the Swedish janitor in Elmer Rice&apos;s Street Scene. He repeated the role two years later in the film version. That same year he first worked for director John Ford in Arrowsmith (1931). He became a member of Ford&apos;s famed &quot;stock company, and had prominent roles for Ford for the next thirty-five years. He became a most familiar character player, specializing in Scandinavians of various nationalities, but frequently playing a wide variety of other ethnicities. Perhaps his greatest work among many memorable roles was as the pitiful Muley, who recounts the destruction of his farm by the bank in Ford&apos;s masterpiece, The Grapes of Wrath (1940). Although plagued in his later years by failing eyesight, he continued to work steadily into his final years.

She was a successful actress on Broadway, and in 1942 her performance in the play &quot;Jason&quot; was so impressive that she was signed up to act in films. She immediately earned good notice and received star billing in her film debut, Lucky Jordan (1942), starring Alan Ladd. During the mid-1940s she had continued success with strong performances in offbeat but entertaining and successful films like The Man in Half Moon Street (1945), the satirical Brewster&apos;s Millions (1945), and the murder spoof Murder, He Says (1945), which starred Fred MacMurray. Achieving both artistic and box office success, she was clearly on the brink of major stardom. She won the starring role in the prestigious film Heaven Only Knows (1947). But all that changed on New Year&apos;s Eve of 1946 when she picked up three hitchhiking World War II veterans while driving to Los Angeles from Palm Springs, where she had been vacationing. She had a terrible accident, hitting a divider and wrecking the car, which flipped several times. One of the soldiers died and the other two were severely injured. Walker herself was seriously injured, including a broken pelvis. But her career suffered even greater and longer-lasting damage. The survivors of the accident accused her of driving drunk and speeding, and she was brought to trial. She suffered bad press and faced a public that was grateful to World War II veterans for having won the war, and was replaced in Heaven Only Knows (1947). Although she was acquitted of criminal charges, many fans turned against her and major studios were hesitant to hire her. She tried to adapt by portraying ruthless and manipulative women in dark murder mysteries, in which she again showed great talent. She performed with great aplomb in Nightmare Alley (1947), the gritty urban police drama Call Northside 777 (1948), and Impact (1949), an unconventional murder drama that featured a fatal automobile accident her character helped cause. But she could not overcome the stigma of the veteran&apos;s death. By the 1950s, she was reduced to low-budget films that received little notice. After winning a minor role in the Cornel Wilde police drama The Big Combo (1955), her film career ended and she only appeared in a few television shows. In 1960, she made her last television appearance, and that same year her house burned down. Some remaining friends from show business helped her, with some fellow actresses staging a benefit for her, which touched her deeply. She faded from the public view and during the 1960s she experienced health problems. In 1968, she died of cancer. She was 47 years old."

Her father was a circus clown, and as a child she toured the US and Europe with the circus (before motion pictures and after the stage, circuses were the biggest form of entertainment in the world). One could say that Billie was bred for show business. Her family ultimately settled in London, where she was fortunate to see plays in the city&apos;s historic West End, and decided she wanted to be a stage actress. At the age of 18 she made her stage debut and her career was off and running. Her performances were very well received and she became one of the most popular actresses to grace the stage. Broadway beckoned, and since New York City was now recognized as the stage capital of the world, it was there she would try her luck. Billie came to New York when she was 22 and her momentum didn&apos;t stop. She appeared in numerous plays and it was only a matter of time before Hollywood came calling, which is exactly what happened. She made her film debut in the lead role in Peggy (1916). The film was a hit, but then again most films were, as the novelty of motion pictures hadn&apos;t worn off since The Great Train Robbery (1903) at the turn of the century. Later that year she appeared in Gloria&apos;s Romance (1916). In between cinema work she would take her place on the stage because not only was it her first love, but she had speaking parts. Billie considered herself more than an actress--she felt she was an artist, too. She believed that the stage was a way to personally reach out to an audience, something that couldn&apos;t be done in pictures. In 1921 she appeared as Elizabeth Banks in The Education of Elizabeth (1921), then she retired. She had wed impresario Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. of the famed Ziegfeld Follies and, with investments in the stock market, there was no need to work.&#013;&#010;What the Ziegfelds didn&apos;t plan on was &quot;Black October&quot; in 1929. Their stock investments were wiped out in the crash, which precipitated the Great Depression, and Billie had no choice but to return to the screen. Movies had become even bigger than ten years earlier, especially since the introduction of sound. Her first role of substance was as Margaret Fairlfield in A Bill of Divorcement (1932). As an artist she loved the fact that she had dialog, but she had to work even harder because her husband had died the same year as her speaking debut - and work she did. One of her career highlights came as Mrs. Millicent Jordan in David O. Selznick&apos;s Dinner at Eight (1933), co-starring Lionel Barrymore, Wallace Beery, John Barrymore and Jean Harlow - heady company to be sure, but Billie turned in an outstanding performance as Mrs. Jordan, the scatterbrained wife of a man whose shipping company is in financial trouble and who was trying to get someone to loan his company money to help stave off disaster. Her character loved to give dinner parties because a dinner affair at the Jordans had a reputation among New York blueblood society as the highlight of the season. With all the drama and intrigue going on around her, her main concern is that she is one man short of having a full seating arrangement. The film was a hit and once again Billie was back on top. In 1937 she had one of her most fondly remembered roles in Topper (1937), a film that would ultimately spin off two sequels, and all three were box-office hits. In 1938 Billie received her first and only Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of Emily Kilbourne in Merrily We Live (1938). This was probably the best performance of her screen career, but she was destined to be immortalized forever in the classic The Wizard of Oz (1939). At 54 years of age - and not looking anywhere near it - she played Glinda, the Good Witch of the North. The 1940s saw Billie busier than ever--she made 25 films between 1940 and 1949. She made only six in the 1950s, as her aging became noticeable. She was 75 when she made her final screen appearance as Cordelia Fosgate in John Ford&apos;s Sergeant Rutledge (1960). Billie retired for good and lived in Los Angeles, where she died of natural causes on May 14, 1970, at the age of 85."

His father had studied singing and young Gene displayed an early interest in drama and music. Shortly after the 7-year-old danced a Highland fling in a concert given by the 48th Highlanders&apos; Regimental Band, his father joined the band as a Scottish tenor. The Lockhart family accompanied the band to England. While his father toured, Gene studied at the Brompton Oratory School in London. When they returned to Canada, Gene began singing in concert, often on the same program with Beatrice Lillie. His mother encouraged his career, urging him to try for a part on Broadway. Lockhart went to America. At 25, he got a part in a New York play in September, 1917, as Gustave in Klaw and Erlanger&apos;s musical &quot;The Riviera Girl.&quot; Between acting engagements, he wrote for the stage. His first production was &quot;The Pierrot Players&quot; for which he wrote both book and lyrics and played. It toured Canada in 1919 and introduced &quot;The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise&quot; (words by Lockhart, music by Ernest Seitz), which became a very popular ballad.. &quot;Heigh-Ho&quot; (1920) followed, a musical fantasy with score by Deems Taylor and book and lyrics by Lockhart. It had a short run (again, with him in the cast). Lockhart&apos;s first real break as a dramatic actor came in the supporting role of Bud, a mountaineer moonshiner, in Lula Vollmer&apos;s Sun Up (1939) (TV). This was an American folk play, first presented by The Players, a theatrical club, in a Greenwich Village little theater in 1923. After great notices it moved to a larger house for a two-year run. During this engagement, in 1924 at the age of 33, Lockhart married Kathleen Lockhart (aka Kathleen Arthur), an English actress and musician. Gene meanwhile also appeared in a series of performances presented by The Players in New York theaters: as Gregoire in &quot;The Little Father of the Wilderness&quot;; as Waitwell in &quot;The Way of the World,&quot; as Gumption Cute in &quot;Uncle Tom&apos;s Cabin&quot;, and as Faust in &quot;Mephisto.&quot; The Lockharts&apos; daughter, June Lockhart, was born in 1925. She would eventually appear regularly in the television series &quot;Lassie&quot; (1954) and &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (1965). In 1933, Gene and Kathleen were featured in &quot;Sunday Night at Nine,&quot; a radio program presented at New York&apos;s Barbizon-Plaza Hotel. Meanwhile, Lockhart was keeping busy writing articles for theatrical magazines and a weekly column for a Canadian publication, coaching members of New York&apos;s Junior League in dramatics, lecturing on dramatic technique at the Julliard School of Music, and directing a revival of &quot;The Warrior&apos;s Husband&quot;--a formidable schedule. It amused him as he said that, &quot;in spite of [the amount of work in a typical day] I don&apos;t get thin.&quot; Lockhart had by this time taken on the appearance that audiences would see again and again in films--short and plump with a chubby, jowly face and twinkling blue eyes. In 1933, he played Uncle Sid in the Theatre Guild&apos;s production of Eugene O&apos;Neill&apos;s comedy &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot; co-starring George M. Cohan. This was the role that was to bring Lockhart stardom and lead to a contract with RKO Pictures and his first film, By Your Leave (1934). O&apos;Neill wrote to Lockhart: &quot;Every time your Sid has come in for dinner I&apos;ve wanted to burst into song, and every time you&apos;ve come down from that nap I&apos;ve felt the cold gray ghost of an old heebie-jeebie.&quot; The acclaim for his acting in &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot; allowed Lockhart to proceed to Hollywood and remain there almost without interruption. However, he was back on Broadway in December, 1949, when he took over the part of Willy Loman in the New York production of &quot;Death of a Salesman.&quot; Lockhart appeared in over 125 films. Though he often played upright doctors, judges and businessmen, and was in real life described as an amiable and gentle soul, Lockhart is perhaps best remembered on film as a villain who usually ends up cowering in a corner whimpering pitifully before getting his just desserts, a scene he played to the hilt in such movies as Algiers (1938) (for which he was nominated for an Oscar), Blackmail (1939), Geronimo (1939), Northern Pursuit (1943), and Hangmen Also Die! (1943). Late on Saturday, March 30, 1957, Lockhart suffered a heart attack while sleeping in his apartment at 10439 Ashton Avenue in West Los Angeles.

Tor Johnson was born October 19, 1903, in Sweden. Most of his adult life, he was a professional wrestler. Tor started appearing (uncredited, or bit parts) in movies as early as 1934. He was in 31 movies, usually as &quot;Weightlifter&quot; or &quot;Strongman.&quot; Later, he got larger roles with character names. Tor was in the Bing Crosby - Bob Hope movie Road to Rio (1947) as Samson; and had a part in Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion (1950) as Abou Ben. Contrary to how it was depicted in the semi-documentary &quot;Ed Wood,&quot; that Ed approached Tor and asked him if he ever fancied the notion of becoming an actor (and starting his film career), Ed worked with Tor towards the end of his movie career. Ed Wood got Tor to portray Lobo in _Bride of the Monster (1956)_. After appearing in 3 other movies, Ed Wood cast Tor in _Plan 9 from Outer Space (1958)_. Then Ed had Tor reprise his role of Lobo for Night of the Ghouls (1959) -- in that movie, Paul Marco (Kelton the Cop) had a full load in the prop gun he fired at Tor, sparks hit Tor&apos;s arms, which by reflex hit Paul, knocking him unconscious in real life; Tor felt bad about that, but everybody knew it was just a case of the big guy not knowing his own strength. A friend and cohort of Ed&apos;s (and also a writer, director and producer in his own right), was Anthony Cardoza. Ed lived in an apartment on Yucca Street (nicknamed &quot;Yucca Flats&quot;), and in 1961, Anthony cast Tor Johnson in a starring role in his low budget movie The Beast of Yucca Flats (1961). This movie was filmed silent, had dubbed-in sound effects, voiced-over narration, and killed off Tor&apos;s movie career once and for all (and Tor was only paid $300). However, Tor had somewhat of a TV career in the 1960s, appearing on &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; with Groucho Marx, several appearances on &quot;The Red Skelton Show,&quot; and even doing a number of TV commercials. Costars spoke fondly of Tor, remembering, &quot;Tor had such warmth! He was so cooperative-- just a lovely man. As you know, he was a former wrestler ... he would go and have drinks with his opponents after a wrestling match.&quot; And, he lived large. Friends spoke of his gracious wife Greta who made great Swedish dinners, along with desserts consisting of her homemade ice cream with strawberries, bananas, coconuts and whip cream. Little wonder that his son, Karl, grew up to be big and strong, and became a Lieutenant with the San Fernando police. And, some friends would chuckle as they recalled that, as big as he was, Tor drove a midget foreign car which was &quot;not much bigger than he was.&quot; Tor died on May 12, 1971, in San Fernando, CA, of a heart ailment; he was 67."

He would work his way up to aerialist with two circuses and also appear at the 1934 World&apos;s Fair. He then went to New York, where he found work as a male model. Hollywood was his next stop and he entered films in 1938 as a bit player and stuntman. In 1940, at the suggestion of producer Edward Small, he changed his first name to Clayton. He appeared in &quot;B&quot; pictures and serials through 1942, then entered the military. After the war he returned to these supporting roles while concentrating on westerns. By 1949 he was playing the &quot;Masked Man&quot;, but that man was Zorro in Ghost of Zorro (1949). In 1949 he was hired to appear in &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; (1949), the television version of the long-running radio show. One thing he had to do was to work on his voice so that he sounded like the radio Lone Ranger. When he got that right, he became famous, along with Tonto, on the small screen. He was The Lone Ranger from 1949 to 1952, when he was fired in a salary dispute. Along with William Boyd (&quot;Hopalong Cassidy&quot;), Moore was one of the most popular TV western stars of the era. He was replaced by John Hart, but Hart&apos;s tenure was terminated after one season. It was during his time away from the TV show that Moore returned to the big screen to continue his movie career with such memorable movies as Radar Men from the Moon (1952) and Jungle Drums of Africa (1953). Hired back to the series, at a higher salary, Moore remained as The Lone Ranger until the series ended in 1957, after 169 episodes. He appeared in two color big-screen movies continuations of that character, in The Lone Ranger (1956) and The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold (1958). After a lifetime of &quot;B&quot; movie parts, Clayton Moore finally found success in a TV series and continued to make commercials and personal appearances as &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; for the next three decades. At his appearances, he preached the Ranger&apos;s Code of good behavior, which he also practiced, and that image was never tarnished by the types of personal scandals that often affected other stars. In 1975 the Wrather Corp., which owned the series and the rights to the title character, got a court order to stop Moore from appearing in public as &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;. The company planned to film a new big-screen movie of the popular hero and did not want the public to confuse its new star with the old one. It would be the only screen appearance for Clinton Spilsbury , this &quot;new Lone Ranger&quot;.

William Henry Pratt was born on November 23, 1887, in Camberwell, London, England, the son of Edward John Pratt Jr., the Deputy Commissioner of Customs Salt and Opium, Northern Division, Indian Salt Revenue Service, and his third wife, Eliza Sarah Millard.&#013;&#010;His career experienced something of a revival in the 1960s thanks to hosting the TV anthology series &quot;Thriller&quot; (1960) and indie director Roger Corman, with Karloff contributing wonderful performances in The Raven (1963), The Terror (1963), the ultra-eerie I tre volti della paura (1963) and the H.P.

Barbara is loved by her fans for her talent, intelligence, and a dark, mysterious beauty that is unique; her face epitomizes either sweet innocence, or malign evil (she is wonderful to watch either way). At first, Barbara studied to become a painter. In 1957, she joined an acting repertory company. Her feature acting debut was in the British comedy Bachelor of Hearts (1958). At age 21, this strikingly lovely lady, with the hauntingly beautiful face, large eyes, sensuous lips and long, dark hair got her breakout role by starring in La maschera del demonio (1960) (&quot;Black Sunday&quot;), the quintessential Italian film about witchcraft (it was the directorial debut for cinematographer Mario Bava; with his background, it was exquisitely photographed and atmospheric). We got to see Barbara, but did not hear her; her voice was dubbed by another actress for international audiences. After its American success, AIP brought Barbara to America, to star in Roger Corman&apos;s Pit and the Pendulum (1961); (though the film was shot entirely in English, again Barbara&apos;s own voice was not used). By now, Barbara was typecast by American audiences as a horror star. In 1962, she answered an open-casting call and won a role in Federico Fellini&apos;s 8? (1963); she only had a small role, but it was memorable. Reportedly Fellini wanted to use her more in the film, but she was contracted to leave Rome to start work on her next horror movie, L&apos;orribile segreto del Dr. Hichcock (1962) (aka &quot;The Horrible Dr. Hitchcock&quot;). Being a slow and meticulous director, Fellini&apos;s 8? (1963) was not released until 1963. (Later, when Barbara was cast in lesser roles in lesser movies, she would tell the directors: &quot;I&apos;ve worked with some of the best directors in the world. I&apos;ve worked with Fellini!&quot;) More horror movies followed, such as Lo spettro (1963) (aka &quot;The Spectre&quot;), Danza macabra (1964) (aka &quot;Castle of Blood&quot;), Un angelo per Satana (1966) (aka &quot;An Angel for Satan&quot;) and others; this success led to her being typecast in the horror genre, where she more often than not appeared in Italian movies with a dubbed voice. The nadir was appearing in Curse of the Crimson Altar (1968), which was mainly eye candy, with scantily-clad women in a cult. Unfortunately, Barbara got sick of being typecast in horror movies. One of the screen&apos;s greatest horror stars, she said in an interview: &quot;I never want to climb out of another freakin&apos; coffin again!&quot; This was sad news for her legion of horror fans; it was also a false-step for Barbara as far as a career move. Back in America, she met screenwriter James Poe; they got married, and remained together for many years. James Poe wrote an excellent role for Barbara in They Shoot Horses, Don&apos;t They? (1969). The role ended up going to Susannah York, and Barbara wouldn&apos;t act in movies again for five years. Barbara returned to movies in Caged Heat (1974); she was miscast: a few years before, Barbara would have been one of the beautiful inmates, not the wheelchair-bound warden, but her performance won positive reviews. In 1977, she appeared in a film by Roger Corman, based on the true story of a mentally ill woman, I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (1977). Unfortunately, her scenes wound up on the cutting room floor. Barbara appeared in Pretty Baby (1978), but she was in the background the whole time, and her talents were mostly wasted. Barbara would appear in 2 more unmemorable movies. She and James Poe got divorced, (he died a few years later). Barbara appeared in _Silent Scream (1980)_. Maybe because her ex-husband was now dead, or because her acting career was going nowhere, Barbara retired from acting for a decade. However, she had a lot of success as a producer. She was an associate producer for the TV mini-series &quot;The Winds of War&quot; (1983), and produced &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; (1988), for which she got an Emmy award. Her horror fans were delighted when Barbara showed up again, this time on TV in Dark Shadows (1990) (TV), a revival of the beloved 1960s supernatural soap. And she has developed a relative fondness along with a sense of ironic umor about her horror queen status, which was evident in her appearance in the Clive Barker documentary &quot;A-Z of Horror&quot; (1997). The still-lovely Barbara acts occasionally, her latest film was The Prophet (1999). Even well past 60, Barbara is still beautiful and her fans still love her."

The real truth, however, was that she had been placed in a mental institution, where she would remain for years, and he was never told about it (he never saw his mother again until he was in his late 20s). He left school at 14, lying about his age and forging his father&apos;s signature on a letter to join Bob Pender&apos;s troupe of knockabout comedians.

Their show on Broadway, &quot;Good Times,&quot; ran for 456 performances, giving Grant time to acclimatize. He would stay in America. Mae West wanted Grant for She Done Him Wrong (1933) because she saw his combination of virility, sexuality and the aura and bearing of a gentleman. Grant was young enough to begin the new career of fatherhood when he stopped making movies at age 62. One biographer said Grant was alienated by the new realism in the film industry. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he had invented a man-of-the-world persona and a style--&quot;high comedy with polished words.&quot; In To Catch a Thief (1955), he and Grace Kelly were allowed to improvise some of the dialogue. They knew what the director, Alfred Hitchcock, wanted to do with a scene, they rehearsed it, put in some clever double entendres that got past the censors, and then the scene was filmed.

Falmouth was a small sleepy town then, as it is still today. He was one of 12 siblings who were moved to Lakeland, Florida sometime around WWI. Lakeland is where Dan was introduced into show business in 1922 at the age of 14. He ran away from home when the show moved on, and traveled thousands of miles throughout the South in tent, minstrel, vaudeville and theater shows. Dan performed on stage with his brother Willard for 9 years with a stock company in Tampa&apos;s old Rialto Theater. Actress Frances Langford worked with him during this time and it was Dan who told her to go to Hollywood. During this period he met Matilda &quot;Tilda&quot; Mae Spivey on the stage, and married her on February 25, 1933. Tilda had a 2-year-old child from a previous marriage by the name of Arthur &quot;Art&quot; Grant Gifford. Times were tough, so Dan had to get out of show business for a while to make some real money. In 1934 he found work with the Conservation Corps in Homestead, Florida, but show business was always in his heart. Dan knew he had what it took to &quot;make it&quot; in Hollywood, so he decided to make the move to California in 1935. They packed all their possessions into their Ford and started the long, arduous trek across the country. This was during the Great Depression, and money was very tight. They had to stop frequently in various cities across the country to make extra money to continue their journey. Dan was a very good auto mechanic and never had a problem finding this type of work wherever he went. This paid-off once during the filming of To Kill a Mockingbird (1962): During the &apos;mob&apos; scene, one of the cars they were to drive away in would not start. Dan opened the hood, stepped onto the front bumper, and had the car &apos;running&apos; in no time flat. They lived in Panama City, Florida and Shreveport, Louisiana for a while. By the time they reached Texarkana, Arkansas in January 1937, they had to stop for a different reason this time. Tilda was carrying their unborn child, and it was showing signs that it could wait no longer. Tilda&apos;s sister Mary happened to live in Texarkana, and they were able to stay there for a few months until the baby was born, and big enough to travel. Their daughter June Larue White was born February 14, 1937. On April 1, 1937, Dan, Tilda, Art and June continued their journey to Hollywood. They arrived 16 days later, and found a house to rent just an eyeshot away from the &quot;HOLLYWOOD&quot; sign. They lived in this house for 23 years where many movie deals were made, and scripts were written--right in their own living room! Upon arrival in Hollywood, Dan had a hard time finding work and found himself down in Panama working on the Pan American Highway for 6 months. When he returned home in 1938, he found work with Republic Pictures Corp. He made at least 6 movies with Republic in his first year alone. His first known film was a western titled Prairie Moon (1938) with Gene Autry. Dan made $55 a week working on this production. Over the years in Hollywood, Dan claimed to have made nearly 300 films, and 150 television appearances. About 70 percent of these were Westerns. Among his most well-known pictures were The Yearling (1946), Distant Drums (1951), Red River (1948), _To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)_, Giant (1956), Duel in the Sun (1946), _Four Faces West (1948)_, Jailhouse Rock (1957), Touch of Evil (1958) and many many more. Somehow during all this filming, Dan and Tilda found time to have their 3rd child--Donald Curtis White, born November 9, 1941; just 28 days before Pearl Harbor was bombed. Of course, the films that made him famous were his numerous appearances in B-western movies where he played the villain or henchie. His tough, high-cheekboned face with its tight-drawn, expressionless mouth and snake eyes chilled the blood of many a Saturday matinee-er in the &apos;40s and &apos;50s. Dan loved his work, especially all of his &quot;outdoor&quot; pictures. In the &apos;50s and &apos;60s when the films started to dry up, Dan turned to television. He was offered the role of Sam the Bartender in Gunsmoke, but he didn&apos;t want to commit to something like that. He told his best friend Glenn Strange to apply for the job, and the rest is history. Dan lived in California for almost 40 years, but his real love was Florida where he grew up. Upon his retirement, he returned home to Tampa, Florida just down the street from the old Rialto Theater where it all started. He made appearances in &quot;Western Film Round-UP&apos;s&quot; and television talk shows, and was frequently visited by his family in California until his death on July 7, 1980 at the age of 72. Dan left behind three children and 12 grandchildren. Not only will he be recognized and remembered for all his films, but he will also be remembered as a great father and grandfather.

In between, she married Jack Marion Fox, who was 26 compared to her young age of 16. The union was anything but happy, in great part because of Fox&apos;s heavy drinking. In February of 1928 Joan and Jack had a baby girl they named Adrienne. The new arrival did little to help the marriage, though, and in the summer of 1928 they divorced. Now with a baby to support, Joan did something she had no intention of doing--she turned to acting. She appeared in Power (1928) with Alan Hale and Carole Lombard, a small role but a start. The next year she starred in Bulldog Drummond (1929), sharing top billing with Ronald Colman. Before the year was out she was in three more films--Disraeli (1929), The Mississippi Gambler (1929) and Three Live Ghosts (1929). Not only did audiences like her, but so did the critics. Between 1930 and 1931, Joan appeared in nine more movies. In 1932 she starred opposite Spencer Tracy in She Wanted a Millionaire (1932), but it wasn&apos;t one she liked to remember, partly because Tracy couldn&apos;t stand the fact that everyone was paying more attention to her than to him. Joan was to remain busy and popular throughout the rest of the 1930s and into the 1940s. By the 1950s Joan was well into her 40s and began to lessen her film appearances. She made only eight pictures, in addition to appearing in two television series. After Desire in the Dust (1960), Joan would be absent from the movie scene for the next ten years, resurfacing in House of Dark Shadows (1970), reprising her role from the &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; (1966) TV series as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard. Joan&apos;s final screen appearance was in the Italian thriller Suspiria (1977). Her final public performance was in the TV movie Divorce Wars: A Love Story (1982) (TV). On December 7, 1990, Joan died of a heart attack in Scarsdale, New York. She was 80 years old."

Gina, destined to be called &quot;The Most Beautiful Woman in the World,&quot; possibly had St. Brigid as part of her surname. She was the daughter of a furniture manufacturer, and grew up in the pictorial mountain village. The young Gina did some modeling, and from there went on to participate successfully in several beauty contests. In 1947 she entered a beauty competition for Miss Italy, but came in third. The winner was Lucia Bose (born 1931) who would go on to appear in over 50 movies, and the first runner-up was Gianna Maria Canale (born 1927), who would appear in almost 50 films. After appearing in a half-dozen films in Italy, it was rumored that in 1947 film tycoon Howard Hughes had her flown to Hollywood; however, this did not result in her staying America, and she returned to Italy (her Hollywood breakout movie wouldn&apos;t come until six years later in the John Huston film Beat the Devil (1953)). Back in Italy, in 1949, Gina married Milko Skofic, a Slovenian (at the time, &quot;Yugoslavian&quot;) doctor, by whom she had a son, Milko Jr. They would be married for 22 years, until their divorce in 1971. As her film roles and national popularity increased, Gina was tagged &quot;The Most Beautiful Woman in the World&quot;, after her signature movie, _Donna piu bella del mondo, La (1955)_. Gina was nicknamed la &quot;Lollo,&quot; as she embodied the prototype of Italian beauty. Her earthy looks and short &quot;tossed salad&quot; hairdo were especially influential, and in fact there&apos;s a type of curly lettuce named &quot;Lollo&quot; in honor of her cute hairdo. Her film Come September (1961) co-starring Rock Hudson won the Golden Globe as the World&apos;s Film Favorite. In the 1970s Gina was seen in only a few films, as she took a break from acting and concentrated on another career: photography. Among her subjects were Paul Newman, Salvador Dali and the German national soccer team. A skilled photographer, Gina had a collection of her work, &quot;Italia Mia, &quot; published in 1973. Immersed in her other passions (sculpting and photography), it would be 1984 before Gina would grace American TV on &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; (1981). Although Gina was always active, she only appeared in a few films in the 1990s. In June, 1999, she turned to politics and ran, unsuccessfully, for one of Italy&apos;s 87 European Parliament seats, from her hometown of Subiaco. Gina was also a corporate executive for fashion and cosmetics companies. As she told &quot;Parade&quot; magazine in April, 2000: &quot;I studied painting and sculpting at school and became an actress by mistake.&quot; (We&apos;re glad she made that &quot;mistake.&quot;) Gina went on to say: &quot;I&apos;ve had many lovers and still have romances.

Born Charles Henry Simpson to Fred and Bertha Rogers Simpson in Rochester, New York, his paternal heritage was Irish. He was the eldest of four sons, one of whom, Richard, died in childhood. When his father was unable to work following the 1929 stock market crash, his mother supported the family as a waitress. By his twenties, he had grown into a hulking figure and considered a boxing career. He has been referred to in some sources as the 1935 &quot;New York City Heavyweight Boxing Champion,&quot; but the only official records of his ring work are for two fights in Los Angeles in 1939, both of which he lost. Simpson, nicknamed &quot;Mickey,&quot; arrived in Los Angeles in the late 1930s. Some unconfirmed stories have him working as a chauffeur for Claudette Colbert. In 1939, he reportedly played a tiny bit part in his first film, Stagecoach (1939), a film whose director, John Ford, would loom large in Simpson&apos;s career. Simpson found fairly steady movie work as various guards, cops, bouncers, and thugs until his career was interrupted by World War II, in which he reportedly served in the U.S. Army. When he returned to Hollywood, it was Ford who resurrected his career, giving Simpson a small but notable role as one of Walter Brennan&apos;s sons in My Darling Clementine (1946). Simpson would appear in a total of nine Ford films, though his most familiar role is probably that of Sarge, the racist diner owner who beats up Rock Hudson near the end of Giant (1956). Simpson worked, primarily in lesser roles, until his 57th year. He died of heart failure in Northridge, California, near his Reseda home, on 23 September 1985, at the age of 71.

He then moved to New York where he earned a number of regional roles in the Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia areas before making his Broadway bow with &quot;The Marriage Game&quot; in 1913. He proceeded to build up his resume impressively with the plays &quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot; in 1914 and when it was revived in 1918, &quot;The Broken Wing (1920), &quot;Craig&apos;s Wife (1925), &quot;Ladies Leave&quot; (1929) and &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; (1933).

She returned in the mid-30s, as a teenager this time, and began the typical assembly-line route of extra and bit roles for various mega studios, this time billed as Marjorie Moore. Her first speaking role was in Columbia Studio&apos;s programmer Murder in Greenwich Village (1937), this time billed as Marjorie Reynolds (her first husband&apos;s last name), a moniker she kept for the duration of her career. The blonde (originally brunette) actress then went through a rather unchallenging prairie flower phase opposite Hollywood&apos;s top western stars such as Tex Ritter, Buck Jones, Roy Rogers and Tim Holt. It all paid off, however, when she won the top female role opposite Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire in the seasonal film classic Holiday Inn (1942), a role originally designed for Mary Martin. It remains Marjorie&apos;s most popular and cherished role on film, but it did not help her make a permanent transition into &apos;A&apos; quality fare. She continued as a dependable &quot;B&quot; co-lead in such films as Up in Mabel&apos;s Room (1944), Meet Me on Broadway (1946), and Heaven Only Knows (1947), with an exciting movie offer such as Fritz Lang&apos;s Ministry of Fear (1944) coming her way on a rare occasion.

In the course of the following decade, he also performed in an American vaudeville tour with his young wife, Frances, in a routine called &quot;The Suffragette.&quot; As World War I grew in scale, Zucco returned to England to join the army. He saw action and was wounded in his right arm by gunfire. Subsequent surgery partially handicapped the use of two fingers and a thumb. However, having honed his theatrical talents, he proceeded to enter the London stage scene and was rewarded with a developing career that made him a leading man as the 1920s progressed. By 1931 he began working in British sound films, his first being Dreyfus (1931) with Cedric Hardwicke. What followed were 13 B-grade movies through 1935, until The Man Who Could Work Miracles (1936) with Roland Young and Ralph Richardson. Zucco was on his way to America and Broadway by late 1935. He had signed to play Disraeli opposite Helen Hayes in the original play &quot;Victoria Regina,&quot; which ran from December 1935 to June 1936. After that came a Hollywood contract and his first American picture, Sinner Take All (1936). Zucco had a sharp hawk nose, magnetic dark eyes, and an arching brow that fit well with authoritative and intimidating characters. That same year, he was in the second installment of the &quot;Thin Man&quot; series, followed by a series of supporting roles in nine films in 1937, usually typed as an English doctor or lord character. They were good supporting roles in &quot;A&quot; films, but he was also taking on darker characters. This was evident in Charlie Chan in Honolulu (1938) and more so with Arrest Bulldog Drummond (1939). Here, he was Rolf Alferson, alias the criminal mastermind &quot;The Stinger,&quot; who could administer a poisonous sting from a needle at the tip of his cane. It was a typical pop movie in the pulp mystery/horror genre with the usual sort of ending, but it started him on the road as a Hollywood arch villain. That same year, he was cast as Professor Moriarty, the brilliant archenemy of the world&apos;s most famous detective in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1939). Also that year, he and Hardwicke reunited to play the dark clerical heavies in the classic The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939). Although into the early 1940s Zucco was still getting some variety in shady roles, he was increasingly accepting parts as mad doctors--ancient and otherwise--starting with The Mummy&apos;s Hand (1940), the sequel to the original The Mummy (1932). Although this was made by the relatively major Universal Pictures, Zucco began grinding out outlandish horror stuff for bottom-of-the-barrel Producers Releasing Corp. (PRC). It would be incorrect to say he sold out to the horror genre, though, even if horror buffs have made him their own. Into the later 1940s, he was still giving good accounts as nobles, judges and not-so-mad doctors in such &quot;A&quot; hits as Captain from Castile (1947), Joan of Arc (1948), and Madame Bovary (1949). Zucco was in real life an engaging personality and was also known as a very dependable actor. He suffered a stroke not long after his final film, David and Bathsheba (1951), once more in Egyptian garb but this time not even credited. He retired and lived on in fragile health. He evidently recovered his health enough to be offered the role of the mad scientist in Voodoo Woman (1957), but he declined.

Robinson only after the star, Leslie Howard, threatened Warner Bros. that he would quit unless Bogart was given the key role of Duke Mantee, which he had played in the Broadway production with Howard. The film was a major success and led to a long-term contract with Warner Bros. From 1936 to 1940, Bogart appeared in 28 films, usually as a gangster, twice in Westerns and even a horror film. His landmark year was 1941 (often capitalizing on parts George Raft had stupidly rejected) with roles in classics such as High Sierra (1941) and as Sam Spade in one of his most fondly remembered films, The Maltese Falcon (1941). These were followed by Casablanca (1942), The Big Sleep (1946), and Key Largo (1948). Bogart, despite his erratic education, was incredibly well-read and he favored writers and intellectuals within his small circle of friends. In 1947, he joined wife Lauren Bacall and other actors protesting the House Un-American Activities Committee witch hunts. He also formed his own production company, and the next year made The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948). Bogie won the best actor Academy Award for The African Queen (1951) and was nominated for Casablanca (1942) and as Captain Queeg in The Caine Mutiny (1954), a film made when he was already seriously ill. He died in his sleep at his Hollywood home following surgeries and a battle with throat cancer."

In the latter film, he began his highly successful partnership with Ginger Rogers, with whom he danced in 9 RKO pictures. During these years, he was also active in recording and radio. On film, Astaire later appeared opposite a number of partners through various studios.

For a while he traveled with a band of gypsies throughout the Continent, but left to study art and painting in Paris. After several years of traveling and various business ventures in South America and Asia he returned to the US and decided to become involved in the theater. He got a job as a singer in several touring theatrical companies, and in 1919 made his film debut in Oh Boy! (1919) in a role he had played on the stage. He spent some time in vaudeville as a monologist, and took his act to Europe and Asia. When he returned to the US he was performing his show on a Los Angeles stage when he was spotted by director Erich von Stroheim, who though D&apos;Arcy was just right for the part of the villainous, arrogant Prince Mirko in The Merry Widow (1925) (Von Stroheim had wanted to play the part himself, but was forbidden from doing so by MGM production head Irving Thalberg). It was a troubled production - from which Von Stroheim was fired, brought back, then fired again - but the film was a great critical and financial success, and D&apos;Arcy received rave reviews for his superb portrayal of the cruel, dissolute Mirko.&#013;&#010;Over the next few years he played villainous roles in a number of low-budget productions (Revolt of the Zombies (1936), Captain Calamity (1936), Under Strange Flags (1937)), but his final film was a major one, the Ginger Rogers/Fred Astaire musical The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939), after which he retired. He then started his own real estate business. He died in 1969."

In fact, she received the greatest fame of her fellow performing brothers Joseph Eaton and Charles Eaton and sisters Pearl Eaton and Doris Eaton. Sister Evelyn was a stage manager and brother Robert was never lured into the business. The star of both the 1920 and 1922 editions of the Ziegfeld Follies, blond Mary was Florenz Ziegfeld&apos;s backup in case his biggest star, Marilyn Miller, proved too recalcitrant. Eaton later replaced Miller as Eddie Cantor&apos;s leading lady in the phenomenally successful Broadway hit_Kid Boots (1923)_ and again in 1927 in Sunny. But Mary was a natural for talking picture stardom and was teamed with an aging Broadway juvenile, Oscar Shaw, in the Marx Brothers_The Cocoanuts (1929)_. She followed that up in the lead role of the all star cast_Glorifying the American Girl (1929)_. However, fame fades quickly and the Eaton family found themselves unwanted by the end of the &apos;30s, on stage and on film. Mary, Pearl and Charles turned to alcohol. Mary married three alcoholics and died young of severe metamorphosis of the liver in 1948 aged 47. Pearl was murdered in her Manhatten Beach apartment in 1958 aged 60. The crime has never been solved. Charles died in 2004, aged 94. Doris is still living and occasionally working at 103 years."
