- Adjust their visibility and position.
- Explore various behavior options while selecting rows using mouse clicks and Shift/Ctrl key combinations.
- See how check boxes synchronize their selected state between group rows and their child rows.
- Apply different paint styles to a form (the Look&Feel menu item).
