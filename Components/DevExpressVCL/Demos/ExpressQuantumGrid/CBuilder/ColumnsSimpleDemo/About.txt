This application demonstrates the capabilities of a select number of inplace editors found in the ExpressQuantumGrid Suite.
It also demonstrates how custom hints can be provided for data cells - see the hint for the Company column cells: it shows contact information (in order to show the hint main window has to be active).
In both views, on the intersection of the header and indicator, there is a Quick Customization button (<View>.OptionsCustomize.ColumnsQuickCustomization). Clicking it will display a drop down list of columns. You can show/hide/move those columns using this list.
Notice that captions of the columns in the Quick Customization popup and filter dialogs are different from the captions in the column headers. This is done using the <Column>.AlternateCaption property.

In this demo you can:

CUSTOMERS (Master)

- choose a State via the drop down list (MRUEdit - its dropdown is maintained in the most recently used order)

- select a City via the dropdown (the additional button invokes a webpage with U.S city information)

- set a Prefix via its dropdown list

- toggle Customer status by clicking in the checkbox

- edit ZipCode or FaxPhone using the MaskEdit editor
