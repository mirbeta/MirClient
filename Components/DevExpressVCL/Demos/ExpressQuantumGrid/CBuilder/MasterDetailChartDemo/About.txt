In this demo you can see how the ChartView can be used to show data from a detail dataset for each master row.

The MaxDetailHeight property of the master level is used to limit the maximum height of the detail ChartView (by default it uses all the available space).

The number of visible columns for the Orders chart is limited to 10 by the chvOrders.OptionsView.CategoriesPerPage property.
Values of the Payment Amount series are sorted from high to low.
Take a look at the custom hint for chart values (columns). It shows information about the order under the mouse cursor. This is retrieved from several datasets and hidden series.

On the Products page you can see a ChartView connected to a query using the DetailInSQLMode option of the data controller. The VaryColorsByCategory feature was used to show each column with different color.
