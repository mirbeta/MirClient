This example demonstrates the following layout features of the CardView:

- Categories - they can be expanded/collapsed and their state affects all cards (<Row>.Kind = rkCategory)

- Horizontal/Vertical row layout inside a card (<CardView>.RowLayout, <Row>.Position, <CardView>.OptionsCustomize.LayeredRows). You can customize row layout via drag & drop

- Horizontal/Vertical card layout inside a CardView (<CardView>.LayoutDirection)

- Card auto width - card widths are automatically modified from their original value (<CardView>.OptionsView.CardWidth) to use all available horizontal space (<CardView>.OptionsView.CardAutoWidth). Use the "View | Card auto width" menu item to modify it

Additionally, this demo shows a new highlighting behavior: focused row caption and selected card borders are drawn using selection style (<CardView>.Styles.Selection)
