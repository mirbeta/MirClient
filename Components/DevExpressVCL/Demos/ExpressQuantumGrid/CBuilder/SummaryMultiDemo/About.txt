In this demo you can:

- see different summary sets depending upon the grouped column for the Car, Payment Type and all other columns

- change the summary type or select several summary types for each column (right-click on a summary cell)

- sort group rows by group value or by group summary (right-click on a group row);
  you can sort by any group summary or group footer summary, but note that some of them are removed from the list of available summaries: this is done by using the <SummaryItem>.VisibleForCustomization property;
  sorted summary values are underlined

- calculate summaries using selected data rows only (see Options/Summary)

- ignore Null values for the Count and Average summaries of the Payment Amount column (see Options/Summary)

- base footer summaries on actual row values or on the group summaries (see Options/Summary)

- change group footers visibility (see Options/Group Footers)

- show single or multiple summaries for each column (see Options/Multiple Summaries in Footer/Group Footers)

- see how custom summaries for records with Payment Amount greater than $300,000 are calculated in code

- note that Min summaries are shown in blue and Max in red - this is done using the OnGetFooterSummaryStyle event
