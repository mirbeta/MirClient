In this demo you can:

- first, uncheck the checkbox in the filter row (near the bottom)  to display all planets and moons

- second, group by "orbits" to show moons by their planet (drag the column header to the grouping area)

- experiment with sorting and filtering (by clicking on a column header)

- incremental search by pressing keys on keyboard
