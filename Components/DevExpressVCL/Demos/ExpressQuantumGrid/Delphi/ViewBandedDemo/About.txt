In this demo you can:

- drag/drop columns between bands (or to the grouping panel)

- move and size bands (thus moving several columns at once)

- see how to create/delete bands at runtime

- temporarily hide bands and/or columns by dragging to the Customization dialog (see Options/Column Customization).

- see how removing a band puts its columns into the Columns page of the dialog, ready for re-use in a different band.
