This program manages software project issues.

The panel on the right contains editors for displaying/modifying the fields of the current record. However, you may prefer to edit the focused record directly within the grid using the in-place editors.

Use the tabs placed on the left side of the grid or the View menu to switch the data display. Options include a simple list, grouped data and a master-detail display.

Summary details can be modified as required. Right-click on the summary footer to select the type of the calculation for the column.

To insert/delete records, use the navigator in the right side panel or simply press the Insert or Delete via the keyboard.

When you begin working with the program, you should specify:
 - the department;
 - the list of users for each department;
 - the list of projects;
 - the manager for each project;
 - the project team for each project.

After that, you should schedule work for each person for the coming week. Finally, enter data for your project, i.e. the list of project items to be managed.
