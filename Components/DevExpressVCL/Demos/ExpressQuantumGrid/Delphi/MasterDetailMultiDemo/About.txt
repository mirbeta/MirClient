In this demo you can:

- switch between Genre tabs and see movies of the corresponding genre. Only one set of grid views (master and details) is used. Data is provided by the dynamic query

- see a movie's detail data such as Companies/People/Photos by expanding the movie grid row

- change the position of the Genre tabs using the "View/Genre Tab Position" submenu (<Grid>.RootLevelOptions/<Level>.Options.DetailTabsPosition).
Note that when tabs are located at the top of the grid, not all of them are visible and a scroll button(s) is provided to access invisible tabs

- show/hide tabs for details with no data via the "View/Tabs For Empty Details" menu item (<Level>.Options.TabsForEmptyDetails)

- customize tab appearance using the "Tab Style" and "Tab Caption Alignment" submenus (<Grid>.LevelTabs.Style/CaptionAlignment)
