In this demo you can:

- switch between the Outlook 2003 and Standard GroupRow styles (see "Options/Outlook 2003 GroupRow Style" menu item)

- group data by clicking on the column headers (see "Options/Group by Sorting" menu item)

- show all groups as permanently expanded (see "Options/Always Expanded Groups" menu item)

- try different kinds of grouping against DateTime data ("Sent" and "Received" columns) available via the "DateTime Grouping" submenu

- note that filtering options (available from the column header filter popup) for the "Sent" and "Received" columns include dates and relative filters instead of actual DateTime values
