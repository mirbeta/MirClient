In this demo, you can:

- Select one or more months displayed as tokens including a month name and an icon.
- To select a month, start typing its name into the editor's input field and either select a month from the lookup drop-down window or complete the name manually and press the Enter key. Note that duplicates cannot be selected.
- To remove a token, either click its Close button or press the Backspace key when the caret is positioned after the token.
- Change the different behavior and appearance options.
- See how the edit value is updated in response to token selection and option customization.
