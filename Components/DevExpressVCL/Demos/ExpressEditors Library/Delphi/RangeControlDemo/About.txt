In this demo, you can:

Try the three built-in clients for numeric range selection, date-time range selection, and date-time range selection via clickable intervals.

Adjust a range in any of the following ways:
 - Drag two selection thumbs to mark the lower and upper bounds;
 - Drag the mouse within the client area to mark new bounds;
 - Drag the current selection within the area to move both the bounds simultaneously;
 - Drag the selection scroll thumb of the Zoom&Scroll bar located at the control's bottom edge;
 - In the DateHeader client, click any header displayed by the ruler to select the range specified by the header's caption.

Zoom the selection in/out by:
 - Using the mouse wheel while holding down the Ctrl key.
 - Dragging the zoom grips of the Zoom&Scroll bar.

Specify the manner in which range controls visualize values - lines, area, or bars.

Switch the visibility of scales and customize their interval.

Toggle the animation and change the visibility of other range elements (the Options menu item).

Apply different paint styles to a form (the Look&Feel menu item).
