This demo shows how to validate data input in standalone editors using the built-in validation capabilities.

In this demo, you can:
- Input data into each editor and either move focus or click Validate in order to validate your input.
- Correct input errors based on the requirements displayed in error hints and labels shown next to editors.
- Try various validation options to customize validation error display.
- See how the Properties.OnValidate event is handled to provide editor-specific validation results.
- See how a custom error icon is specified for the Person editor via the Properties.ErrorIcon property.
- See how error hints are provided using a hint style controller and ScreenTip repository.
- Apply different paint styles to a form (the Look&Feel menu item).
