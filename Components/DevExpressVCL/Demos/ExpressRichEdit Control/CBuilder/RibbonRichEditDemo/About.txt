This sample application demonstrates how to create an RTF editor with a Ribbon interface using the TdxRichEditControl component and ExpressBars components. The TdxRichEditControl component provides rich text editing capabilities and actions to link to Ribbon UI elements shipped with the ExpressBars Suite.

In the demo you can:

1)  Manage documents, format and manipulate text using Ribbon and context menu commands.

2)  Use the Options dialog (via the Options item) to customize the appearance and behavior of the Ribbon.

    • Pick between four different Ribbon-based styles: Office 2007 Ribbon, Office 2010 Ribbon, Office 2013 Ribbon, and the Windows Scenic Ribbon.
    • Select a color scheme (a theme or skin) to apply to the Ribbon form.
    • Select a color accent for the Office 2010, Office 2013, or Windows Scenic style Ribbon.
    • Choose the manner in which hint information is displayed on-screen.

3)  Switch the Touch Mode option located in the Quick Access Toolbar to make the size of tappable Ribbon UI elements fit the average size of a fingertip, and revert back to the default size.

4)  Invoke the document's context menu to quickly access some popular content management commands.

5)  Invoke the Ribbon control's context menu and select 'Customize the Ribbon...' or 'Customize Quick Access Toolbar...' to try the runtime customization capabilities.
