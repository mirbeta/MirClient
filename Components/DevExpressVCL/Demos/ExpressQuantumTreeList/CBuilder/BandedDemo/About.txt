In this demo you can:

- drag and drop columns between bands

- size and move bands, moving several columns at once. You can also nest bands within other bands
      
- create or delete bands at runtime (see the Options menu or right-click any band header)
      
- temporarily hide bands, or columns, or both by:
  - dragging them to the Customization form (see Options|Customization Form...)
  - clicking items within the Quick Column/Band Customization dropdowns. To invoke the dropdown, click the button located to the left of the leftmost column/band.

- see how removing a band puts its columns into the Columns page of the Customization form, ready for re-use in a different band

- invoke the column header context menu to customize the visibility and layout of tree list elements
