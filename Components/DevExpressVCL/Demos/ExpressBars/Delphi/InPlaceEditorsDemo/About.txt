This demo is built using all in-place editors from the ExpressEditors library (sold separately).
These in-place editors are grouped into functional categories.
You can click a category's name to see in-place editors within the category.

In this demo you can:
- edit values using in-place editors located on toolbars and submenus;
- switch the Ribbon UI on/off by toggling the "Ribbon style" option;
- customize bar appearance settings by applying different paint styles, Ribbon color schemes, and font settings;
- customize bar editor appearance settings using editor styles in the Styles category;
- dock toolbars to any edge of the form to see how bar editors appear in horizontal and vertical bar layouts.
