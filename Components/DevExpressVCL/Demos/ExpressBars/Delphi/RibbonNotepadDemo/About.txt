This sample application demonstrates how easy it is to create an RTF editor with a Ribbon interface similar to that found in Microsoft Office 2007 and higher.

To emulate the appearance and layout capabilities of the Microsoft Office Ribbon, it uses our TdxBarManager, TdxRibbon, TdxRibbonBackstageView, TdxRibbonBackstageViewGalleryControl, TdxBarApplicationMenu, TdxRibbonMiniToolbar, TdxRibbonPopupMenu, TdxRibbonRadialMenu, TdxBarScreenTipRepository, TdxRibbonStatusBar, TdxRibbonDropDownGallery, and TcxImageList components.

In the demo you can:

1)  Use the Options dialog (via the Options item) to customize the appearance and behavior of the Ribbon.

    • Pick between five different Ribbon-based styles: Office 2007 Ribbon, Office 2010 Ribbon, Office 2013 Ribbon, Office 2016 Ribbon, Office 2016 Tablet, and the Windows Scenic Ribbon.
    • Select a color scheme (a theme or skin) to apply to the Ribbon form.
    • Select a color accent for the Office 2010, Office 2013, Office 2016, Office 2016 Tablet, or Windows Scenic style Ribbon.
    • Choose the manner in which hint information is displayed on-screen.

2)  Switch the Touch Mode option located in the Quick Access Toolbar to make the size of tap-able Ribbon UI elements fit the average size of a fingertip, and revert back to the default size.

3)  Make a selection within the editor to show the 'Selection Tools' contextual tab and Ribbon Mini Toolbar (provided that the corresponding Context Menu Style option is enabled). 

4)  Invoke the document's context menu. Based on Context Menu Style setting, this menu will be represented either as a radial or traditional popup menu.

5)  Invoke the Ribbon control's context menu and select 'Customize the Ribbon...' or 'Customize Quick Access Toolbar...' to try the runtime customization capabilities.
