Experiment with displaying/hiding background images at runtime.

In this demo you can:

- hide background images of one or more toolbars

- replace images with your own 

- see the effect of changing the display style

Note the use of dxBarManager1.LockUpdate in the cbShowImageCaptionsClick event handler.
