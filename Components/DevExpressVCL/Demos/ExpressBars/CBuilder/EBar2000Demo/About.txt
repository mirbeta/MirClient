This demo shows formatting options provided by ExpressBars.

Experiment by changing options in the group boxes. In particular:

- see the way a button is displayed when using different styles when Down=True (Align Left button).

- move the mouse over toolbar buttons to see the effect of the hot image support.

- display complete toolbars by dragging them into floating windows or by checking the Multiline options.

- floating toolbars can be made invisible or partially transparent by using the AlphaBlend trackbars.
