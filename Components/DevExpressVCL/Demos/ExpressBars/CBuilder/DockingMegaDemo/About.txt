This demo shows how ExpressBars provides docking facilities similar in style to MS Visual Studio.

Experiment with docking - you can dock, undock panels, autohide and float them

Set the Font and Color of docking panels and change the View Style (see Style Menu)

You can also set properties for each docking panel - select an item in the Solution Explorer and change its properties in the Properties panel.

Use the 'Save Layout' followed by 'Load Layout' to show the persistance of settings at runtime.
