This demo illustrates how you can build reports using the TChart component.

The demo allows you to perform the following:

- Use the Report Designer to customize a report as you need.
- Open the Print dialog to choose the print destination and printer settings.
- Use the Preview dialog to preview and then print a report, or export it to a .PDF file.
- Use the Page Setup dialog to change the print settings before printing the report.
- Apply anti-aliasing to images in a report, to make image edges smoother.
- Apply one of the three built-in styles specific to the Print Preview dialog.

Note that initially, you can only use the Standard style of the Print Preview dialog. However, if you open a project's form and build the project, units of the following Print Preview dialog styles are automatically added to the 'uses' clause:
- Ribbon (if the ExpressBars Suite v6 is installed).
- Advanced (if the ExpressBars Suite is installed).

As a result, the Ribbon and Advanced menu items are automatically added to the Options | Preview Dialog Style menu at runtime.
