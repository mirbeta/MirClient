This demo illustrates how you can build reports for the grid control.

The demo allows you to perform the following:

- Use the Report Designer to customize a report as you need.
- Open the Print dialog to choose the print destination and printer settings.
- Use the Preview dialog to preview and then print a report, or export it to a .PDF file.
- Use the Page Setup dialog to change the print settings before printing the report.
- Apply anti-aliasing to images in a report, to make image edges smoother.
- Apply one of the three built-in styles specific to the Print Preview dialog.

Note that initially, you can only use the Standard style of the Print Preview dialog. However, if ExpressBars Suite v6 is installed, you can enable the Ribbon and Advanced Print Preview dialog styles. To accomplish this, open a project's main form and build the project. As a result, the corresponding menu items will be automatically added to the Options | Preview Dialog Style menu at runtime.
