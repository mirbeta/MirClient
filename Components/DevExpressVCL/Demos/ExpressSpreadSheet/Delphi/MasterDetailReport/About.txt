This demo shows how to create a spreadsheet-based multi-level report using data from datasets linked into master-detail relationships.

In this demo, you can:

- Customize the report template:
  - Manage report sections (the Report | Sections submenu).
  - Add dataset fields to spreadsheet cells using drag and drop (the Field Chooser panel). Note that fields in this panel are nested to reflect the relationships established between the datasets.
  - Build formula expressions using dataset fields.

- Filter the master dataset to provide data of specific suppliers (the Filter Options panel).

- Build and preview a report (the Report | Preview menu item).

- Apply different paint styles to forms (the Look&Feel menu item).
